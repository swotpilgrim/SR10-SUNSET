# Chapter 15: Confusion Sets In

Friday afternoon found me at Foster's Flowers, arranging a large wedding bouquet while my mind wandered in circles. Tomorrow was the Romano family dinner—my official introduction to Nick's family, his world, the people who'd shaped him into who he was.

The prospect terrified me.

"You're cutting those stems too short," Mama observed from across the worktable.

I looked down and realized she was right. I'd been trimming on autopilot, my distracted hands working while my brain spun with anxiety.

"Sorry. I'm not focused today."

"Clearly." She set down her own arrangement. "What's wrong, honey?"

"Sunday dinner at Nick's house. Meeting his whole family. His nonna who apparently has opinions about everything. His two older sisters who will probably judge me. His parents who'll wonder if I'm good enough for their son—"

"Breathe," Mama interrupted gently. "You're spiraling."

I set down my scissors and took a deep breath. "What if they don't like me?"

"Then Nick will still like you, and that's what matters. But they will like you, because you're wonderful and Nick clearly adores you." She reached across the table and squeezed my hand. "Besides, any family that raised someone as kind as Nick is probably pretty kind themselves."

"You're right. I know you're right. I'm just..." I gestured vaguely at my general state of anxiety. "I really care about him, Mama. Like really care. And that makes everything feel higher stakes."

"Love does that."

"Is that what this is? Love?"

"What do you think it is?"

I considered the question honestly. "I think about him constantly. I miss him when we're apart. I want to know everything about his life, his dreams, his secrets. When something good happens, he's the first person I want to tell. And when he talks about music or his family or anything that matters to him, I could listen for hours." I looked at Mama. "That's love, isn't it?"

"Sounds like it to me."

The bell above the shop door chimed, and I looked up to see Nick entering with a bouquet of daisies. My whole face brightened automatically.

"Speak of the devil," Mama said with a knowing smile. "I'll be in the back room if you need me."

She disappeared tactfully, leaving Nick and me alone in the shop.

"Hi," he said, holding out the daisies. "These are for you."

"You brought me flowers? I work in a flower shop."

"I know. But these ones come with the message that I'm thinking about you." He leaned across the counter to kiss me. "And also to thank you for agreeing to tomorrow night. I know meeting the family is intimidating."

"I'm terrified," I admitted, taking the daisies and breathing in their fresh, simple scent. "What if they hate me?"

"Impossible. My mother already loves you based on my descriptions. My dad's going to like anyone who makes me this happy. And my nonna..." He paused. "Okay, my nonna is going to interrogate you like you're applying for a job. But it comes from love."

"That's not reassuring."

"She'll ask about your intentions, your family, whether you can cook. Standard Italian grandmother stuff." He grinned. "I've already warned her to behave, but I make no promises."

I groaned. "Maybe I should bring something? A dessert? Would that help?"

"You don't have to bring anything except yourself. But if you want to score points, my nonna loves cannoli from Moretti's Bakery on Fifth Street."

"Cannoli from Moretti's. Got it." I pulled out a vase and started arranging the daisies he'd brought. "What else should I know? Any topics to avoid? Family drama I should be aware of?"

"Don't mention the Dodgers leaving Brooklyn. My dad's still bitter about it. Don't ask my sister Angela about kids—she and her husband are having trouble and it's sensitive. And whatever you do, don't suggest that store-bought pasta sauce is acceptable. That's heresy in the Romano household."

I laughed despite my nerves. "This is a lot of rules."

"You'll be fine. Just be yourself. That's who I fell in love with, and that's who they'll love too."

The casual way he said it—like loving me was the most natural thing in the world—made my chest warm.

"I love you too," I said, still getting used to saying it out loud. "Even though you're about to throw me into what sounds like a very loud, very opinionated family dinner."

"It builds character." He reached across the counter to tuck a strand of hair behind my ear. "I can't wait for you to meet everyone. They're going to love you, Diane. How could they not?"

His confidence was infectious. By the time he left—with a promise to pick me up Sunday at four o'clock—I felt marginally less terrified.

That evening's Bayside Boys performance had a different energy. Maybe it was knowing Labor Day was only two weeks away, or maybe it was the way Nick kept catching my eye during songs, but everything felt heightened. More real.

When Peter announced that the end-of-summer show would feature special guests and extended performances, the crowd erupted with excitement. I felt my stomach clench with fresh nerves.

Two weeks. We had two weeks until I'd have to stand on that stage and perform in front of hundreds of people.

After the show, during our walk home, I voiced my anxiety.

"What if I freeze again? What if all our practice doesn't matter and I just completely blank when I'm up there?"

"You won't," Nick said with certainty. "You're not the same person who froze at auditions. You know the material inside and out. You've performed with me dozens of times in practice. Your voice is strong and confident now."

"In The Melody Box back room. Not in front of a massive crowd."

"So we'll practice in front of people. Build up your comfort level." He thought for a moment. "What if we did a small preview performance? Just for our families, before the big show? Let you get used to being watched without the full boardwalk crowd pressure."

The idea had merit, even if it still sounded terrifying. "You think that would help?"

"I think anything that makes the big performance feel less like a cliff jump and more like a step forward will help." He squeezed my hand. "We're in this together, remember? I'm not going to let you fail."

"You can't promise that."

"No, but I can promise I'll be right there beside you, whatever happens. That has to count for something."

It did. It counted for everything.

We'd reached my building, and Nick pulled me into our alcove for what had become our nightly ritual of goodnight kisses and reluctant parting.

"Tomorrow at four," he reminded me between kisses. "Wear something comfortable. My family's not formal."

"Got it. Comfortable. Cannoli from Moretti's. No comments about the Dodgers or pasta sauce."

"You're going to be perfect." One more kiss. "I can't wait for them to meet you."

"I can't wait either. And by can't wait, I mean I'm terrified but also excited."

"That's the spirit."

I floated upstairs, the daisies he'd brought clutched in one hand, my lips still tingling from his kisses.

Mama was reading in her chair but looked up when I entered. "Those are pretty."

"Nick brought them." I found a vase and arranged them on the kitchen table. "He came by to remind me about dinner tomorrow and make sure I knew what I was getting into."

"And do you?"

"Loud, opinionated, lots of food, possible interrogation by his Italian grandmother. Did I miss anything?"

Mama laughed. "Sounds like a family that cares. Those are usually the best kind."

I thought about that as I got ready for bed. A family that cared. A boy who loved me. A performance in two weeks that would either be my triumph or my second public humiliation.

Everything felt uncertain and terrifying and wonderful all at once.

I looked at the daisies on my nightstand—simple, unpretentious, beautiful in their straightforward way. Like Nick himself. Like what we'd built together.

Tomorrow I'd meet his family. In two weeks, I'd perform beside him in front of hundreds of people. And after that... who knew?

But for the first time all summer, the uncertainty didn't scare me. Because whatever came next, I wouldn't be facing it alone.

I had Nick. And that made everything feel possible.

Even the impossible things.
