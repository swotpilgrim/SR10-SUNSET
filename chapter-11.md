# Chapter 11: The Walks Become Routine

Three weeks had passed since the auditions, and walking home with Nick had stopped feeling like a novelty. It had become as natural as breathing—something I counted on, looked forward to, needed.

"Your mother's giving me a look," Nick said one evening as we passed Foster's Flowers. Mama was visible through the window, arranging the display, and she waved when she saw us.

"What kind of look?"

"The kind that says she's forming opinions about us."

"Is there an 'us'?" The question slipped out before I could stop it.

Nick's step faltered slightly. "Isn't there?"

My heart skipped. "I don't know. Is there supposed to be?"

"I'd like there to be," he said quietly. "If you would."

We kept walking, but everything felt different now. The air seemed charged with possibility, and I was acutely aware of the small distance between us—how easy it would be to reach out and take his hand.

I didn't, though. Not yet. But knowing I could was enough for now.

"Tell me about your family," I said, needing to fill the weighted silence with something safe. "You've mentioned them, but I don't really know the details."

Nick seemed relieved by the subject change. "Five kids—two older sisters, me in the middle, two younger brothers. My sisters are both married already, and my brothers are still in school. Dinner at the Romano house is chaos."

"Sounds wonderful."

"It is. Loud, but wonderful." He smiled, clearly picturing it. "Sunday dinners are mandatory unless you're dead or dying. Everyone talks over each other, my nonna yells from the kitchen in Italian, and someone always ends up crying because the pasta's too good."

"Crying over pasta?"

"You haven't had my nonna's carbonara. It's a religious experience."

I laughed, enjoying the image of his loud, chaotic, loving family. So different from my quiet apartment with just Mama and me, where conversation happened in careful measured doses.

"Your family knows about the duet?" I asked.

"Oh yeah. They're all planning to come to the Labor Day show. My nonna's already making special biscotti to bring." He glanced at me, slightly embarrassed. "She's excited that I'm finally doing something other than standing in the background."

"You should invite her to The Melody Box sometime. She can hear us practice."

"She'd love that." His expression was warm. "She'd also immediately start planning our wedding, so fair warning."

My cheeks burned, but I couldn't help smiling. "I've been warned."

We walked a bit further before Nick spoke again, his tone more serious. "I told my family about you. About how we met, about the audition, about these walks."

"What did you tell them?"

"That I met someone who actually sees me. Who listens to the bass line instead of just the melody." He stopped walking, turning to face me. "That's rare, Diane. You're rare."

I didn't know what to say to that. The sincerity in his voice made my throat tight.

"You see me too," I managed finally. "Not just as the flower shop girl or the quiet one in the crowd. You see the person underneath."

"Yeah." His smile was soft. "I do."

We stood there on the sidewalk, the boardwalk lights glowing warm behind us and the sound of waves constant in the background. It would have been so easy to kiss him right then—to close the small distance and see what his lips tasted like.

But I wasn't quite ready. And Nick seemed content to wait.

We started walking again, and the conversation shifted to lighter topics. But something had changed in that moment of stillness. An acknowledgment of what was growing between us, even if we weren't ready to name it yet.

The next several evenings followed the same pattern. Performance, then the walk, then lingering outside Foster's Flowers while Mama watched from upstairs windows and pretended not to.

Sally cornered me on Thursday afternoon at the arcade.

"So when are you two going to actually go on a date?" she demanded, abandoning all pretense of subtlety.

"What are you talking about?"

"You and Nick. The walks, the long conversations, the moony looks. When does it become official?"

"We're friends," I said, but the word felt inadequate.

"Right. Friends who stare at each other like you're solving the mysteries of the universe." Sally rolled her eyes. "Di, he clearly likes you. You clearly like him. What are you waiting for?"

"I don't know," I admitted. "It just feels... we're figuring something out. Building something. I don't want to rush it."

"You've been walking home together for three weeks. How is that rushing?"

Fair point. But there was something delicate about what Nick and I were creating—something that felt like it needed to develop at its own pace rather than being forced into traditional dating structures.

"I'll know when it's time," I said finally.

Sally looked skeptical but didn't push. "Fine. But don't wait too long. Summer ends, remember? And then what?"

Her question echoed in my head all afternoon. Summer was already mid-August. Labor Day weekend was only two weeks away. After the performance, after the tourists left, after everything returned to normal—what would happen to these walks? To whatever Nick and I were building?

That evening's walk had a different quality—both of us more aware of time passing, of the temporary nature of summer magic.

"Two more weeks until the big show," Nick said as we approached my building.

"Don't remind me. I'm trying not to think about it."

"You're going to be amazing. We've been practicing every week, and you get stronger every time."

"I'm still terrified of freezing again."

"You won't. You know the material now, you're comfortable with the arrangement, and I'll be right there." He squeezed my hand—the first time he'd done that—and the casual touch sent warmth through my whole arm. "We're in this together."

I looked down at our joined hands, then up at his face. His expression was open, hopeful, patient.

"Nick, I—" I started, not sure how to finish.

"You don't have to say anything," he interrupted gently. "I just wanted you to know I'm not going anywhere. Even after summer ends, even after the performance. Whatever this is between us, I want to keep figuring it out. If you do."

"I do," I said immediately. "I really do."

His smile could have lit up the whole boardwalk.

"Good." He released my hand slowly, reluctantly. "See you tomorrow?"

"Tomorrow," I confirmed.

I floated upstairs, my hand still tingling from his touch. Mama looked up from her sewing with a knowing expression.

"Good walk?"

"The best." I collapsed onto the couch beside her. "Mama, what does it mean when being with someone feels both exciting and comfortable at the same time?"

"It means you found something real." She set down her sewing. "Butterflies are nice, but comfort—that's what lasts."

I thought about that. Peter had given me butterflies—that nervous, fluttery feeling of attraction. But Nick gave me something different. Something steadier and deeper. Something that felt like home.

"I think I'm falling for him," I admitted.

"I know, honey. I could see it happening."

"Is it supposed to feel like this? Like everything's changing and staying the same all at once?"

"That's exactly what it's supposed to feel like." Mama smiled. "Your father and I started as friends. Best friends. And then one day I looked at him and realized he wasn't just my friend anymore. He was my person."

"How did you know?"

"Because being with him felt like the most natural thing in the world. Like all the pieces finally fit together the way they were supposed to."

I thought about walking with Nick, talking with Nick, the way conversations flowed easily and silences felt comfortable. How being near him made everything feel right.

"Yeah," I said softly. "That's how it feels."

That night, instead of looking at old performance flyers and dreaming about Peter, I thought about Nick's hand in mine. About his patient teaching at The Melody Box. About the way he listened when I talked, really listened, like my words mattered.

About the difference between wanting someone's attention and actually wanting someone.

For the first time all summer, I let myself imagine a future past Labor Day. Past the performance, past summer's end. A future with evening walks and music and someone who saw me—really saw me—and chose to stay anyway.

It was a quiet dream, not flashy or dramatic. But it was real.

And that made it infinitely more valuable than any fantasy I'd ever had about Peter Castellano.
