# Chapter 18: The Empty Feeling

I woke Monday morning with the weight of last night's date heavy on my chest. Sunlight streamed through my window, oblivious to my mood. I'd dreamed about Nick—our walks, his patient teaching, the way his face lit up discussing music.

In the dream, I'd tried to explain the Peter date had been a mistake. But no words came, and he just kept walking away, getting smaller until he disappeared.

I dressed for work at the flower shop on autopilot, choosing the plainest blouse and skirt from my closet. Downstairs, Mama had breakfast waiting but I could barely manage toast.

"You're thinking about him," she said, not making it a question.

"About which him?" But we both knew.

"The one whose family dinner you missed yesterday."

I set down my toast, appetite gone completely. "What do I even say to Nick? 'Sorry I cancelled our plans to go on a terrible date with someone else'? That makes me sound awful."

"You could start with the truth. That you made a mistake."

"What if he doesn't want to hear it? What if he's moved on?"

"Only one way to find out."

The day crawled by. Customers came and went at Foster's Flowers, welcome distractions from my churning thoughts. I arranged bouquets with mechanical precision, my hands knowing the work while my mind was elsewhere.

By evening, anxiety had twisted my stomach into knots. Nick would be there. I'd have to face him, see the polite distance he'd probably put between us.

I locked up and walked to the boardwalk feeling like I was heading toward judgment. The evening was warm and beautiful, at odds with my mood. Tourists and locals streamed toward the bandstand.

I found my spot and waited. My heart pounded as the Bayside Boys took the stage.

Peter spotted me in the crowd and winked during the opening song. The gesture that used to make my heart race now just felt empty. Performative. A wink he probably gave to half a dozen girls at every show.

I made myself look away from Peter, seeking Nick at the back of the stage. He stood in his customary position, serious and focused, his bass voice providing the steady foundation the group built upon. He didn't look at the crowd at all—unusual for him. Usually he at least scanned faces, acknowledging regular attendees with small nods.

Tonight he kept his eyes down or fixed on the other performers. Never on the audience.

Never on me.

The romantic ballad started—the one that had been my favorite all summer. Peter's voice wrapped around the melody while Nick's bass line held everything together underneath. I listened with new ears, hearing what I should have heard from the beginning: Nick's voice was the one that moved me. That reached something deep inside and made me feel.

Peter's was just pretty sound laid over someone else's foundation.

The song ended. Applause rippled through the crowd. The Bayside Boys finished their set with an upbeat number that had people clapping along.

When the final notes faded and Peter thanked everyone for coming, the band descended from the stage. Immediately, fans swarmed Peter. Girls asking for autographs, tourists wanting photos, everyone drawn to the spotlight.

I waited at the edge of the dispersing crowd, hoping Nick would appear beside me like he had all those other evenings. Ready for our walk, ready to talk, ready to be the steady presence I'd taken for granted.

Minutes passed. The crowd thinned. Peter noticed me standing alone and broke away from his admirers.

"Hey, Diane! Glad you came tonight." He slung an arm casually around my shoulders. "Want to grab a milkshake? We could hit the diner again."

"I can't tonight. I need to—" I scanned the area, looking for Nick. "I need to talk to someone."

"Suit yourself." Peter shrugged, unbothered. "I'll catch you later."

He returned to his fans, and I stood there feeling foolish and lost. Where was Nick?

Then I saw him at the edge of the equipment area, coiling cables with methodical care. Tommy stood nearby, guitar case in hand, saying something that made Nick shake his head.

I took a breath and walked over before I could lose my nerve.

"Nick?"

He looked up, and I saw him steel himself before turning to face me. "Hey, Diane."

"Can we walk? I mean—if you're not busy. If you have time."

"I should finish packing up." He gestured at the equipment.

"I've got this," Tommy said quickly, taking the cables from Nick's hands. "Go ahead, man."

Nick shot Tommy a look I couldn't quite read, but Tommy just grinned and shooed him away.

"Okay," Nick said finally. "A short walk."

We started down the boardwalk in silence. Not the comfortable silence of before, but heavy and awkward. I searched for words and couldn't find any adequate ones.

"How was your date?" Nick asked, his voice carefully neutral. "With Peter."

"It was..." I struggled for honesty. "It was disappointing."

"Oh. I'm sorry to hear that."

"Are you?"

He glanced at me sharply. "Of course I am. I don't want you to be disappointed."

"Even though I cancelled on your family dinner to go?"

"That's different." He looked away. "That was your choice. You have every right to choose who you want to spend time with."

"What if I chose wrong?"

We'd reached a quieter section of the boardwalk. Nick stopped walking and turned to face me, his expression guarded.

"What do you mean?"

"I mean the date with Peter was awful. Not because he did anything terrible, but because there was nothing there. No real conversation, no genuine interest in who I am. Just him performing at me for two hours while I sat there realizing I'd made a huge mistake."

"Diane—"

"I spent all summer chasing a fantasy," I continued, needing to get it all out. "Watching Peter from a distance, building him up into this perfect person in my head. But he's not perfect. He's just a charming performer, and that's fine for the stage but it's not what I want in real life."

"What do you want?"

The question hung between us. I looked at Nick—really looked at him. The serious dark eyes, the quiet strength, the person who'd stepped forward when I was frozen with fear. Who taught me to hear music differently. Who saw me as more than just another girl in the crowd.

"I want someone who asks questions and listens to answers. Someone who shares what they love and makes space for what I love. Someone who makes me feel truly seen, not just noticed." I paused. "I want what we had before I messed it up."

Nick studied my face, searching for something. "And Peter?"

"Was a mistake. A fantasy I needed to chase so I could finally see it for what it was—surface shine with nothing underneath." I took a breath. "I'm sorry, Nick. For cancelling on you, for hurting you, for being so blind all summer that I couldn't see what was right in front of me."

He was quiet for a long moment. Around us, the boardwalk continued its evening rhythm—couples strolling, families heading home, the distant sound of music from various shops.

"I understand why you chose him," Nick said finally. "Everyone chooses Peter. He's the obvious choice—handsome, charming, the lead singer. I'm just the bass singer in the background. Why would you look twice at me when Peter Castellano was an option?"

"Because you're real," I said fiercely. "Because when you talk to me, I feel like I matter. Because your music actually means something instead of just sounding pretty. Because you make me want to be braver than I am."

"Diane..." His voice had gone soft, uncertain.

"I know I hurt you. I know I might be too late. But I needed you to know that the date with Peter just made me realize what I'd already known deep down—that it's you I want to walk with. You I want to talk to. You who makes me feel like myself instead of some pale imitation." I twisted my hands together. "If you'll still have me."

The silence stretched so long I thought he might refuse. Might tell me I'd had my chance and blown it.

Then Nick reached out and took my hand, his touch warm and familiar and exactly right.

"I'll always have you," he said quietly. "Even when I was trying to give you space to choose Peter, even when it hurt like hell watching you with him—I couldn't stop wanting this. Wanting you."

Relief flooded through me so powerfully my knees went weak. "Really?"

"Really." He pulled me closer. "But Diane, I need you to be sure. I can't be the consolation prize or the safe second choice. If we do this, I need to know you actually want me. Not just because Peter didn't work out."

"I want you," I said with complete certainty. "Not because Peter disappointed me. Because you make me feel things Peter never could. Because being with you feels right in a way nothing else does. Because I'm pretty sure I'm falling in love with you, and that scares me, but it's true."

His eyes widened. "You're falling in love with me?"

"Yes. Is that okay?"

Instead of answering, he kissed me. Right there on the boardwalk with tourists walking past and evening settling in around us, he kissed me like he'd been holding back for weeks and couldn't anymore.

And it felt completely different from Peter's meaningless cheek-kiss. This felt real and right and like coming home.

When we broke apart, both slightly breathless, Nick rested his forehead against mine.

"I'm falling in love with you too," he whispered. "Have been for weeks. I thought I'd lost you before I even really had you."

"You have me. For real this time. If you'll forgive me for being an idiot."

"Nothing to forgive." He kissed me again, softer this time. "We all chase the wrong things sometimes. I'm just glad you found your way back."

We walked home hand in hand, talking about everything and nothing, comfortable in each other's presence again. At my door, Nick pulled me close for one more kiss.

"What happens now?" I asked.

"Now we figure this out together. You, me, and whatever comes next." He smiled. "Starting with rescheduling that family dinner. My nonna's not going to let you off the hook that easily."

"I'm terrified of your nonna."

"Everyone is. It'll be fine."

I watched him walk away, and this time the warmth in my chest felt right. Not the empty excitement of fantasy, but the solid certainty of something real.

Something worth holding onto.
