# Chapter 19: Nick Pulls Away

The relief of Monday night's reconciliation carried me through Tuesday morning at Foster's Flowers with a lightness I hadn't felt in weeks. Nick and I were okay. Better than okay. We'd finally been honest with each other, and everything felt right again.

But when I arrived at the boardwalk that evening for the performance, something had shifted.

Nick was there, of course, taking the stage with the other Bayside Boys right on time. But when I caught his eye during the opening song, expecting the warm recognition we'd shared last night, he looked away quickly. Not hostile, just... distant.

My stomach sank.

The performance continued, and I watched Nick more than the music. He sang his bass lines perfectly as always, but there was a stiffness to his posture that hadn't been there before. A careful distance he was maintaining even from across the stage.

After the show, I waited at our usual meeting spot. Peter waved as he passed, heading off with Barbara Wellington who'd attached herself to his arm. I barely noticed them.

Minutes ticked by. The crowd thinned. Nick didn't appear.

Finally, I spotted him helping Joey pack up the record player. I walked over, trying to ignore the anxiety tightening my chest.

"Hey." I touched his arm lightly.

He turned, and his smile was polite. Friendly. Nothing like the warmth from last night.

"Hey, Diane."

"Want to walk home?"

He hesitated—actually hesitated—before answering. "I should probably get this equipment sorted. Rain's forecast for tomorrow, and we need to make sure everything's covered properly."

"Oh. Okay." I tried to keep my voice steady. "Maybe tomorrow then?"

"Maybe. We'll see how the schedule works out."

Joey glanced between us with a puzzled frown but said nothing.

I walked home alone for the first time in weeks, my mind spinning. What had changed? Last night he'd kissed me, told me he was falling in love with me. Tonight he could barely look at me.

Had he changed his mind? Realized I wasn't worth the trouble after all?

The next three days followed the same pattern. Nick was polite when we interacted, but he'd erected careful walls between us. No more walks home. No more easy conversation. When I tried to catch his eye during performances, he looked everywhere except at me.

On Friday afternoon, Sally cornered me in Foster's Flowers.

"Okay, what's going on?" She demanded, flipping the sign to closed despite it being only four o'clock. "Tommy says Nick's been weird all week. Quiet, distracted, not himself. And you look miserable. I thought you two worked things out?"

"I thought we did too." I set down the arrangement I'd been working on. "Monday night was perfect. We talked, we apologized, we..." I felt my cheeks warm. "We kissed. He told me he was falling for me. And then Tuesday he just... pulled away. Like none of it happened."

"That doesn't make sense. Tommy says Nick's been crazy about you all summer."

"Maybe he changed his mind. Maybe he realized I'm not worth the drama."

"Or maybe something else is going on." Sally leaned against the counter, thinking. "Did Peter do something? Say something?"

"Peter?" I blinked. "What does Peter have to do with anything?"

"He was your date last weekend. Maybe Nick's worried you're not over him."

"But I told Nick it was a mistake. That Peter disappointed me. That it was Nick I wanted."

"Did you tell anyone else that? Because from the outside, it might look like you dated Peter, it didn't work out, and now you're back to Nick as a consolation prize."

The words hit like ice water. "I would never—"

"I know that. But does Nick? You cancelled on his family dinner to go out with Peter. Then the date went badly, and suddenly you're back saying you want Nick. Can you see how that might make him feel like a backup plan?"

I sank onto the stool behind the counter. "Oh no. Sally, I didn't even think... I was so focused on making things right that I didn't consider how it looked from his perspective."

"Talk to him. Actually talk to him. Make him understand this isn't about Peter disappointing you—it's about you finally seeing what was there all along."

That evening, I went to the boardwalk early, determined to catch Nick before the performance. But he arrived exactly on time with the other boys, giving me no opportunity for private conversation.

During the show, I noticed something that made my chest ache: Nick looked sad. Not obviously—he was too professional for that—but I'd learned to read the subtle shifts in his expression. The way his eyes didn't light up during songs he usually loved. The mechanical precision of his performance lacking its usual passion.

I'd done that. My thoughtlessness, my selfishness, my inability to see past my own feelings had hurt him.

After the performance, Peter approached me before I could get to Nick.

"Hey, Diane. You busy tomorrow night? There's a drive-in showing double features, and I thought we could give us another shot. First date wasn't great, I know, but second chances and all that."

Behind Peter, I saw Nick pause in his equipment packing. Saw him glance over, then deliberately turn away.

"I..." I looked at Peter, then at Nick's retreating back. "Actually, yes. I'm busy."

"Sunday then?"

"Peter, I don't think—" I struggled for honesty. "The other night was nice, but I don't think we're a good match. You're a great performer and a nice guy, but I'm interested in someone else."

Peter followed my gaze to where Nick was methodically coiling cables. Understanding dawned on his face.

"Nick? Seriously?" He didn't sound angry, just surprised. "Huh. Didn't see that coming."

"He's—"

"The better choice, probably." Peter shrugged with his characteristic easy confidence. "Nick's the real deal. Solid guy. Treats people right." He grinned. "Boring as hell, but I guess that's what you're into."

"He's not boring. He's genuine."

"Same thing in my book. But hey, no hard feelings. Good luck with him."

Peter wandered back to his group of admirers, and I finally made my way to where Nick was packing up. He kept his back to me, clearly aware I was approaching but not acknowledging it.

"Nick, can we please talk?"

"Kind of busy right now."

"Please. Five minutes."

He sighed and turned to face me, his expression carefully neutral. "What is it, Diane?"

"I just turned Peter down. He asked me out for tomorrow night and I said no. Told him I'm interested in someone else."

Something flickered in Nick's eyes. "Okay."

"That someone else is you. In case that wasn't clear."

"I got that." He went back to coiling cables. "It's fine, Diane. You don't have to explain your choices to me."

"But I want to. I need you to understand—"

"Understand what? That Peter didn't work out so now you're back to me? I already know that."

The words stung because they weren't entirely unfair. "It's not like that."

"Isn't it? You cancelled plans with my family to date him. Then it went badly, and suddenly you want me again. Can you see how that looks from where I'm standing?"

"I know. Sally explained it to me today, and she's right. I was thoughtless and selfish, and I didn't consider how it looked." I moved closer, forcing him to look at me. "But Nick, you have to know—the Peter thing wasn't real. It was never real. It was a fantasy I needed to chase so I could finally see it for what it was."

"And what I am? Reality? The safe, boring choice after the fantasy disappoints?"

"You're what I actually want, not what I think I should want. There's a huge difference."

He set down the cables, his jaw tight. "I can't be your second choice, Diane. I told you that. If you're with me just because Peter didn't work out—"

"I'm with you because you make me feel seen. Because you listen when I talk. Because your music moves me in ways Peter's never could. Because being with you feels like coming home." I took a breath. "I'm with you because I love you."

The last word hung in the air between us. Nick's eyes widened, and for a moment his careful walls cracked.

"You love me?"

"Yes. I've been falling in love with you for weeks. I was just too stubborn and scared to admit it." I reached for his hand. "The Peter date didn't make me realize I love you. It just confirmed what I already knew deep down and was too afraid to acknowledge."

Nick stared at our joined hands, his expression unreadable. Then slowly, carefully, he pulled away.

"I need time," he said quietly. "To think. To process. This whole week has been... I thought we were okay Monday night, and then I spent Tuesday through Friday watching you and Peter interact and wondering if I was just the consolation prize. I need to be sure this is real for you, not just rebound from disappointment."

The rejection hurt, but I understood it. "Okay. Take whatever time you need."

"Thank you." He picked up his equipment. "I'll see you around, Diane."

I watched him walk away, my heart aching but my resolve firm. Nick needed space, needed to trust that my feelings were genuine. I could give him that.

I would give him whatever he needed.

Even if it meant waiting in uncertainty while he figured out if he could trust me with his heart again.
