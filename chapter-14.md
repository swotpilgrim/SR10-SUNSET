# Chapter 14: Hearing Differently

The revelation that Nick loved me changed everything and nothing all at once. Our walks continued, our rehearsals continued, but now there was a new current underneath—an awareness of depth, of possibility, of futures that extended beyond summer's end.

Wednesday evening's performance drew a smaller crowd than usual. Midweek audiences were always lighter, mostly locals who came for the music rather than the boardwalk spectacle. I stood in my usual spot—though these days "usual" felt like a memory from another lifetime—and watched the Bayside Boys take the stage.

Peter stepped to the microphone with his characteristic charm. "Evening, Bayshore! Hope everyone's having a beautiful summer night."

The crowd responded warmly. Peter grinned and counted off the first song.

But this time, I didn't watch Peter. I watched Nick.

He stood in his customary position at the back, serious and focused as the opening notes began. His bass voice entered first this time, establishing the foundation before Peter's melody floated on top. The song was one of Nick's compositions—I recognized it from his notebook—and I could hear his fingerprints all over the arrangement.

The way Tommy's tenor harmony bridged between Peter's lead and Nick's bass. The tempo shift in the second verse that added emotional weight. The careful construction that made it sound effortless and natural when really it was architecture, mathematics, art.

This was Nick's song. Nick's creation. But Peter performed it like it belonged to him, and the crowd never questioned the attribution.

I found myself getting angry on Nick's behalf, watching him provide the foundation while Peter soaked up applause that should have been shared.

The performance continued through three songs, each one a showcase of Nick's talent disguised as a group effort. When the final note faded and the Bayside Boys took their bow, I felt a surge of frustration.

Nick appeared beside me as the crowd dispersed.

"Ready to walk?"

"Always." I waited until we were away from the main boardwalk crowd before speaking. "That second song. The one with the tempo shift. That was from your notebook, wasn't it? The one you showed me last week?"

"Yeah. We just added it to the set list."

"And did Peter tell the audience you wrote it?"

Nick's expression turned careful. "Diane—"

"Did he?"

"No. But that's not how it works. We're a group. We don't list individual credits during performances."

"But people assume Peter writes everything. You know they do."

"Does it matter what strangers assume?"

"Yes!" I stopped walking, turning to face him. "Yes, it matters. Nick, you're genuinely talented. Those songs are beautiful and complex and they deserve your name on them. You deserve recognition for your work."

"I get recognition from the people who matter. From you, from Mr. Gennaro, from my family."

"What about from everyone else? What about from the people who love your music but don't know you created it?"

He was quiet for a long moment, his dark eyes searching my face. "Why does this bother you so much?"

"Because I spent all summer watching you be invisible. And now I know you chose it, which is somehow worse. You're not invisible because people don't notice you—you're invisible because you've decided that's where you belong."

"I'm the bass singer. Background is where bass singers belong."

"That's garbage and you know it." I softened my tone, taking his hand. "You could be the lead of your own group. You could demand co-writing credit. You could do a hundred things to step into the spotlight. But you choose not to. Why?"

Nick looked away, watching the waves roll in under the evening sky. When he finally spoke, his voice was quiet.

"Do you know what happens to foundation when you remove it? Everything built on top collapses." He met my eyes again. "Peter needs to be the lead. It's who he is. And the group works because we all know our roles and stay in them. If I started demanding recognition, started competing for attention, it would destroy what we've built."

"Or it would make what you've built stronger. Make it more honest."

"Maybe. Or maybe it would end the group entirely, destroy a friendship, and leave me with nothing but my pride." He shook his head. "I'm not willing to risk that."

I understood, even if I didn't agree. Loyalty was important. Friendship mattered. But watching someone diminish their own talent for someone else's comfort made my chest ache.

"Okay," I said finally. "I won't push. It's your choice to make."

"Thank you."

We resumed walking, but the mood had shifted. Not sour exactly, but weighted with things unsaid.

"I'm not trying to start a fight," I said after a few minutes of silence. "I just... I see so much in you, Nick. So much talent and potential. And it frustrates me that you don't see it yourself."

"I see it. I just don't need everyone else to see it too." He squeezed my hand. "Having you see it is enough."

"Is it really? Or is that another thing you tell yourself so it hurts less?"

He smiled despite himself. "You're not going to let me hide behind comfortable lies, are you?"

"Not a chance."

"Good." He pulled me closer as we walked. "I need someone to challenge me. To push back when I'm being stubborn."

"Then consider yourself pushed." I leaned into his shoulder. "I just want good things for you. Recognition, success, all of it. You deserve more than being Peter's background music."

"What if I told you I'm happy being background music? That I genuinely prefer the structure and support role to the spotlight?"

"Then I'd believe you. As long as it's really what you want and not just what you've convinced yourself to want because the alternative feels too scary."

We'd reached my building, but instead of going into our usual alcove, Nick led me to the railing overlooking the beach. The ocean stretched out dark and endless, waves rolling in with steady rhythm.

"Can I tell you something?" Nick said quietly. "And you have to promise not to use it against me in future arguments about my career choices."

"I promise."

"The truth is, stepping forward scares me. Really scares me. I've spent my whole life being the support, the foundation, the one holding everything else up. The thought of being the one in front, the one people are watching, the one who could fail visibly..." He shook his head. "That terrifies me."

"Like I was terrified at the audition?"

"Exactly like that. And you remember how that felt—the panic, the freezing, the certainty that you were about to humiliate yourself in front of everyone."

"I also remember you stepping forward to help me."

"Because that's my role. I'm good at supporting. I'm not sure I'd be good at leading."

I thought about that, about fear disguised as preference, about how we convince ourselves that our limitations are actually our choices.

"You know what I think?" I said carefully. "I think you're braver than you realize. You wrote me a song and we're performing it in front of hundreds of people. That's stepping forward. That's being visible."

"That's different. That's with you. I'm not alone in that."

"You wouldn't be alone if you demanded credit for your compositions. You'd have your group behind you, your family supporting you, and me in your corner." I turned to face him directly. "Nick, I'm not saying you have to change everything tomorrow. I'm just saying... don't let fear disguised as contentment keep you from becoming everything you could be."

He was quiet for a long time, processing. Finally: "When did you get so wise?"

"Since I met someone who taught me that fear is just an emotion, not a life sentence."

He pulled me into a hug, holding me close while the waves crashed below and the boardwalk lights glowed warm behind us.

"Thank you," he murmured into my hair. "For seeing me. For pushing me. For not letting me hide."

"Thank you for doing the same for me."

We stood like that for a while, wrapped in each other and the summer night, both of us thinking about futures and fears and the courage it takes to step forward into the unknown.

When we finally pulled apart, Nick's expression was thoughtful.

"The Labor Day performance," he said. "When we do our duet, I want to introduce the second song properly. Tell the audience I wrote it. Give myself credit instead of hiding behind group attribution."

My heart swelled. "Really?"

"Really. It's just one song, one moment. But maybe that's how this works—one brave moment at a time until brave becomes normal."

I kissed him then, there on the boardwalk railing with the ocean as our witness, pouring all my pride and love and hope into that single gesture.

"I love you," I said when we pulled apart. "I know you said I didn't have to say it back, but I need you to know. I love you, Nick Romano. All of you—the bass singer and the songwriter and the boy who's scared but brave anyway."

His smile could have outshone the moon.

"I love you too. In case that wasn't already obvious."

We walked the final distance to my door hand in hand, both of us grinning like fools, both of us thinking about Labor Day and performances and the small brave steps that lead to bigger changes.

When I climbed the stairs and looked back, Nick was still standing on the sidewalk, watching me go. He waved, and I waved back, and everything felt right in a way it never had before.

Not perfect. Real. Which was infinitely better.
