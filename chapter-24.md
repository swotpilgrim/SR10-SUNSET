# Chapter 24: Performing Together Again

The stage felt smaller than I remembered. Or maybe Nick just stood closer, close enough to smell his aftershave mixed with salt air. Close enough to see the careful blankness he'd arranged across his features like armor.

Peter gestured us to center stage where two microphones stood side by side. The crowd settled into expectant silence. My pulse hammered so hard I wondered if Nick could hear it.

"Ready?" he asked quietly, not quite meeting my eyes.

I wanted to say so many things. Instead I just nodded.

The opening notes drifted through the evening air—piano and guitar creating the foundation Nick had arranged weeks ago. Before everything got complicated.

Nick drew a breath and began the bass line a cappella, letting his voice carry alone for the first measure. Deep and resonant and achingly beautiful, filling the space between boardwalk and ocean with sound that seemed to come from his very soul.

I'd heard him sing this line dozens of times in practice. But tonight it hit differently. Tonight I wasn't thinking about technique or harmony or hitting the right notes. Tonight I was listening to him—really listening—the way I should have been all summer.

My cue approached. I took a breath and joined in, my soprano finding the melody line we'd practiced. Our voices blended the way they always had, that inexplicable chemistry that had won us the competition. But something was different now.

Better.

Because I wasn't fighting it anymore. Wasn't pretending the connection didn't exist. I was finally letting myself feel everything I'd been running from.

The lyrics told a story about summer ending and finding something unexpected. About looking for one thing and discovering another. Nick had written these words before everything fell apart, but they felt prophetic now.

I stopped singing to the crowd. Stopped performing. Instead I turned toward Nick and sang directly to him, trying to communicate through the music what I didn't know how to say in words.

That I saw him. That I was sorry. That it had always been him.

That I loved him.

His eyes flicked toward me briefly, surprised, then away again. But I kept singing to him, kept pouring every ounce of truth and regret and hope into the harmonies we'd built together. My soprano wove around his bass line, dancing through the spaces between notes, finding new depths I'd never reached before.

Because I meant it now. Every word, every note, every breath.

The second verse began and I watched his face, searching for any sign that he understood what I was trying to tell him. His expression remained carefully neutral but I caught the smallest flicker of something—confusion maybe, or hope—before he locked it down again.

We hit the bridge and the harmonies grew more complex, our voices wrapping around each other in the intricate arrangement Nick had crafted. This was the part we'd struggled with in practice, both of us getting tangled trying to maintain our separate lines while staying connected.

But tonight it worked perfectly. Tonight my voice found his like it belonged there, like we'd been singing together for years instead of weeks. The notes spiraled upward, building tension and beauty and truth.

And I saw the exact moment he realized I wasn't performing anymore.

His eyes met mine fully for the first time since I'd stepped onto the stage. The careful neutrality cracked, revealing surprise and confusion and something that looked dangerously like hope. His voice never wavered—too professional, too disciplined—but his gaze held mine, questioning silently.

I smiled at him through the lyrics, trying to show him with my expression what the music was already saying. That this was real. That I meant every note. That he wasn't second choice or consolation prize or anything except exactly what I wanted.

His walls cracked further. I saw it happen in real time—the defenses dropping, the careful distance shrinking, the person I'd fallen for emerging from behind the protective armor he'd wrapped himself in.

We moved into the final chorus together, our voices rising in parallel harmonies that showcased the conversation between soprano and bass. No longer two separate lines but a true duet, each part strengthening and highlighting the other. Creating something neither could accomplish alone.

The arrangement called for a gradual decrescendo, both voices fading together into silence. But Nick had added a small coda weeks ago—a final phrase where the bass line held steady while the soprano danced one last embellishment above it before joining in unison for the final note.

Foundation and flourish. Steady and soaring. Nick and me.

We hit the last note together and held it, letting it fade naturally into the evening air. The sound dissolved slowly, our voices blending until they became indistinguishable from each other, from the ocean, from the summer night itself.

For one perfect heartbeat, there was absolute silence. The crowd held its breath. The world paused.

Then applause erupted like a wave crashing over the boardwalk. People were on their feet, cheering and whistling and calling our names. I heard Mama's voice and Sally's distinctive squeal and Mr. Gennaro shouting "Brava!" in his heavy Italian accent.

But I didn't look at the crowd. I only looked at Nick.

He stared back at me with an expression so raw and vulnerable it made my chest ache. All the walls were gone now, stripped away by music and truth. I could see everything he felt written across his face—hope and fear and longing and love.

So much love.

"Diane," he whispered, so quietly I almost couldn't hear it over the applause.

Before I could respond, Peter appeared between us, clapping Nick on the back with genuine enthusiasm. "That was incredible! Absolutely incredible! You two are really something special together."

Nick stepped back instinctively, the walls starting to rebuild. No, I thought desperately. Not again. Not when we'd finally broken through.

Peter grabbed both our hands and raised them toward the crowd, showman to the end. "Let's hear it again for my talented friends—Diane Foster and Nick Romano!"

More applause. More cheering. Peter soaked it in naturally, comfortable in the spotlight, pulling us forward with him.

But I wasn't paying attention to Peter or the crowd or anything except Nick's hand in mine and the way he wouldn't quite look at me anymore. The moment was slipping away, dissolving like the last note of our song.

The other Bayside Boys joined us on stage for the final bow. Tommy winked at me knowingly. Joey grinned. Peter waved to the crowd with practiced charm.

And Nick started to pull his hand from mine.

I held on tighter, refusing to let him retreat. He glanced at me, surprise flickering across his face.

"Don't," I said quietly, too low for anyone else to hear. "Please don't pull away again."

Something shifted in his expression. Not quite hope, but maybe the beginning of belief.

Peter was thanking the crowd, making final announcements about how much the Bayside Boys appreciated everyone's support all summer. The other boys waved and started backing off the stage. Nick moved to follow them.

I kept his hand firmly in mine, anchoring him in place.

"Diane—" he started.

"We need to talk," I said. "After this. Before you disappear. Please."

He hesitated, conflict clear on his face. Part of him wanted to protect himself, to maintain the safe distance he'd created. But another part—the part I'd seen break through during the song—wanted to stay.

"Please," I repeated.

The applause was dying down. Peter had descended the stairs to sign autographs and accept congratulations. Tommy and Joey were helping disassemble equipment. The performance was ending, the crowd dispersing, summer winding down to its final moments.

Nick looked at me for a long moment, searching my face for something. Whatever he found there must have convinced him because he nodded slowly.

"Okay," he said quietly. "After we pack up. I'll meet you by The Melody Box?"

Relief flooded through me so powerfully I felt lightheaded. "Yes. I'll wait."

"You're sure?" His voice held careful restraint, like he was protecting himself from hoping too much. "Because Diane, I can't—I can't do this again. If you're still choosing Peter—"

"I'm not choosing Peter," I interrupted fiercely. "I haven't been choosing Peter for weeks. I've been choosing wrong and running scared and generally being an idiot, but I'm done with all that."

The smallest hint of a smile touched his lips. "An idiot?"

"A complete idiot. Sally's been telling me for days and she's absolutely right."

"Sally usually is."

We were still standing on stage, still holding hands, while the world continued around us. Someone called Nick's name—equipment needed moving. Mr. Gennaro was approaching with what looked like thank-you gifts for the performers.

"I should help pack up," Nick said, but he didn't move.

"I'll wait by The Melody Box. I'll wait all night if I have to."

"You won't have to." He squeezed my hand once more, then released it reluctantly. "Thirty minutes. I promise."

I nodded, not trusting my voice.

Nick descended the stage stairs and disappeared into the post-performance chaos of equipment breakdown and lingering fans. I stood alone for a moment, my hand still tingling where he'd held it, my heart racing with everything we'd communicated through music and everything still left to say in words.

Sally appeared beside me, grabbing my arm and practically vibrating with excitement.

"Did you see the way he looked at you? Oh my God, Diane, I thought he was going to kiss you right there on stage in front of everyone!"

"We need to talk first," I said. "He's meeting me by The Melody Box in thirty minutes."

"Then we need to get you ready." Sally pulled me toward the stairs. "Come on, you can't have this conversation looking like you've been standing under stage lights. You need to fix your hair and maybe some lipstick—"

"Sally, I don't think—"

"Trust me. When you're about to tell a boy you love him, presentation matters."

My steps faltered. "I didn't say I love him."

Sally stopped and looked at me with exasperated affection. "Honey, everyone watching that duet could see it. You were practically singing 'I love you' in four-part harmony. Now come on, we have thirty minutes and you're not going to waste them."

She pulled me into the dispersing crowd, chattering about makeup and hair and what I should say, but I barely heard her. My mind was already at The Melody Box, already practicing the words I'd been too afraid to speak all summer.

I love you. I choose you. I'm sorry I was too blind to see it sooner.

The foundation that had been there all along.

Thirty minutes. Then I would finally, finally tell him the truth.
