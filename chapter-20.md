# Chapter 20: The Realization Begins

Peter picked me up Friday evening in his father's Chevy, and I climbed in with a sense of resignation rather than excitement. This was what I'd agreed to—another chance, even though I already knew how it would end.

"Looking forward to the movie?" Peter asked as we pulled away from Foster's Flowers.

"Sure." I watched the boardwalk lights slide past my window.

The drive-in theater sat on the outskirts of town, a massive screen facing rows of parking spaces where cars lined up with speakers hooked to their windows. Peter found a spot near the middle, pulled in, and attached the speaker to his side.

"Perfect. Got a great view." He draped his arm across the back of the seat behind my shoulders. "This is better than that diner date, right? More private."

The movie started—something with Rock Hudson that I couldn't focus on. Peter kept up a running commentary, talking over the dialogue, pointing out funny moments, barely pausing for breath. I made appropriate noises at appropriate times, but my mind was elsewhere.

With Nick, specifically. With the hurt I'd seen in his eyes when he pulled away. With the careful distance he'd put between us and the walls I didn't know how to breach.

"You're quiet," Peter said halfway through the first feature.

"Just watching the movie."

"Right." He leaned closer. "You know, we don't have to just watch. That's not really what drive-ins are for."

He tilted my chin toward him and kissed me. Not the gentle cheek-kiss from our first date, but something more insistent. More purposeful.

I pulled back instinctively. "Peter—"

"Come on, Diane. I thought that's what you wanted. That's why girls come to drive-ins with guys." His smile was coaxing. "We can have fun."

"I'm not ready for that."

"It's just kissing. Nothing serious."

But it wasn't just kissing. It was the assumption that I'd agreed to something beyond watching a movie. The expectation that being here meant I owed him physical affection. The complete lack of interest in what I actually wanted.

"I should go home." I reached for the door handle.

Peter caught my arm, not roughly but firmly. "Hey, wait. I'm sorry. I misread things. We can just watch the movie, okay? Don't leave."

I hesitated, then settled back into my seat. Peter removed his arm from around my shoulders, putting visible space between us. The rest of the first feature passed in awkward silence.

By the time the second movie started, Peter had resumed his running commentary, seemingly unbothered by the earlier tension. He talked about himself, about the Bayside Boys, about plans for next summer. Never once asking how I felt about what had happened. Never acknowledging that he'd made me uncomfortable.

Driving home, he chatted cheerfully about the movie while I stared out the window. When we reached my house, he walked me to the door with his usual confidence intact.

"So, third time's the charm?" He grinned. "Want to try again next weekend?"

"I don't think so, Peter."

His smile faltered slightly. "Come on. Tonight wasn't that bad."

"It wasn't good either." I met his eyes directly. "You're a nice guy and a talented performer. But we're not a good match. I'm not interested in dating you."

"Is this about Nick?" Peter's tone shifted, becoming slightly defensive. "Because if it is, you should know he's not exactly boyfriend material. The guy's practically invisible. You'd be bored in a week."

"Nick is kind and genuine and actually interested in me as a person. That's not boring—that's what matters." I pulled out my key. "Goodnight, Peter."

"Your loss." He shrugged, his ego clearly more bruised than his heart. "Could've been fun."

I went inside and closed the door, leaning against it with my eyes shut. Mama appeared from the kitchen, one look at my face telling her everything she needed to know.

"Worse than the first date?"

"Different kind of bad." I sank onto the couch. "He tried to kiss me, like really kiss me. And when I pulled away, he acted like I was being difficult. Like I'd agreed to that by coming to the drive-in."

"Did you tell him to stop?"

"Yes, and he did. He apologized even. But Mama, he never asked what I wanted. Never considered that maybe I just wanted to watch the movie. He just assumed."

She sat beside me, wrapping an arm around my shoulders. "Some boys think certain situations come with certain expectations. It's not right, but it happens."

"Nick would never do that. Nick asks permission before anything. He makes sure I'm comfortable. He actually cares what I want." Tears pricked my eyes. "And I hurt him by choosing Peter. By making him feel like a consolation prize. I was so stupid."

"You weren't stupid. You were figuring things out. Sometimes we have to get what we think we want before we understand what we actually need."

"But what if I figured it out too late? What if Nick can't trust me anymore?"

"Then you give him time and space to work through it. And you show him through your actions, not just your words, that you mean what you say." She squeezed my shoulder. "Real love is patient, honey. If what you and Nick have is real, it'll survive some uncertainty."

That night I lay in bed staring at my ceiling, Peter's entitled kiss still feeling wrong on my lips. The contrast between his assumption and Nick's careful asking for permission was stark.

Nick had asked every time. "Can I kiss you?" "Is this okay?" "Are you comfortable?"

Peter had just taken. Assumed his charm and status entitled him to whatever he wanted.

How had I spent all summer thinking Peter was the prize?

Saturday morning, I went to Foster's Flowers determined to work through my confusion with bouquets and baby's breath. But my hands moved on autopilot while my mind replayed the entire summer.

Meeting the Bayside Boys that first Fourth of July performance. Fixating on Peter because he was handsome and charming and the obvious choice. Signing up for the audition hoping to win his attention. Freezing on stage in panic.

And Nick stepping forward.

That was when everything had changed, I realized. The moment Nick's bass voice wrapped around my panic and gave me something solid to hold onto. That was when I'd started falling without knowing it.

All the walks home. The conversations about music and family and dreams. The easy silences. The way he saw me—really saw me—and liked what he saw.

I'd been falling for Nick for weeks. Maybe from that very first moment he stepped forward to help me.

I'd just been too stubborn to admit it because fantasy was safer than risk.

Peter was safe. A crush from a distance, all daydreams and no vulnerability. If he never noticed me, I could never be disappointed. If he did notice me, I could bask in the validation without having to be truly known.

But Nick required vulnerability. Being with Nick meant letting him see all of me—the fears and insecurities and imperfections. The real me, not the performance version.

That's what I'd been running from all summer. Not toward Peter, but away from the terrifying intimacy Nick offered.

And now I'd hurt him with my cowardice.

"You look like you've had a revelation," Sally said, appearing in the shop doorway with two Coca-Colas.

"I've been an idiot," I said flatly.

"Well, yes. But specifically?"

"I was never chasing Peter. I was running from Nick. Because Peter was safe and Nick is terrifying."

Sally handed me a Coke and sat on the stool. "Explain."

"Peter could never hurt me because I didn't actually know him. It was all fantasy. But Nick..." I took a shaky breath. "Nick knows me. Really knows me. The good parts and the embarrassing parts and everything in between. Being with him means being truly seen, and that's scary. What if he sees all of me and decides I'm not enough?"

"What if he sees all of you and loves you anyway?"

The simplicity of it hit me square in the chest. "That's what he's been trying to show me all summer, isn't it? That he sees me and wants me anyway. And I kept running toward the fantasy because reality required courage I didn't have."

"So get the courage now." Sally's voice was firm. "Tell him. All of it. Not just that you're sorry, but why you were so blind. Nick's a smart guy—he'll understand."

"What if he doesn't want to hear it? What if I've hurt him too much?"

"Then at least you tried. At least you were brave enough to be honest." She squeezed my hand. "But Di, I've seen how he looks at you. That boy is crazy about you. He's just scared of being the consolation prize. Show him he's not."

That evening's performance felt different. I stood in my usual spot, but this time I didn't look at Peter at all. I watched Nick exclusively.

His bass voice anchored the opening song. His careful attention guided the other singers. His musical genius shaped every arrangement, making the songs beautiful even from the shadows.

And I heard it—finally, clearly, without fantasy clouding my judgment.

Nick's voice was the one that moved me. The one that reached into my chest and made me feel. Not Peter's pretty melody, but Nick's steady foundation.

The romantic ballad started, and I closed my eyes, letting the harmonies wash over me. Peter's lead was fine—technically perfect, emotionally adequate. But Nick's bass underneath gave the song its weight, its truth, its heart.

I'd been listening to the wrong voice all summer.

When I opened my eyes, Nick was looking directly at me for the first time in days. Our gazes locked across the distance between stage and audience, and something passed between us. A question, maybe. Or a hope.

I smiled at him—small, tentative, but real.

And for just a moment, his careful walls cracked enough to smile back.
