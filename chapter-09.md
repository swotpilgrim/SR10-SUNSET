# Chapter 9: The First Real Conversation

The walk home from the boardwalk had become our unspoken ritual. After each evening performance, Nick would pack up his equipment, exchange a few words with the other Bayside Boys, and then appear at my side as I lingered at the edge of the dispersing crowd.

"Walk you home?" he'd ask, even though we both knew the answer.

Tonight was no different, except tonight felt different. Maybe because it was our third walk together, and the newness was wearing off, replaced by something more comfortable. More real.

"How was the shop today?" I asked as we fell into step, heading down the quieter end of the boardwalk.

"Mr. Gennaro sold a whole collection of jazz records to a collector from Philadelphia. Put him in a good mood for the rest of the day." Nick's hands were in his pockets, his pace unhurried. "How was the flower business?"

"Mrs. Patterson ordered arrangements for her daughter's engagement party. Mama's been planning the design all afternoon."

It was small talk, ordinary conversation about ordinary things. But somehow it didn't feel small. It felt like we were building something—a foundation of our own, brick by brick, conversation by conversation.

We walked in comfortable silence for a while, the sound of waves and distant boardwalk music filling the space between words. The evening was warm, and lights were beginning to flicker on along the boardwalk, transforming the weathered wood into something magical.

"Can I ask you something?" I said, breaking the silence.

"Sure."

"Why music? What made you want to study composition?"

Nick's expression shifted, becoming more animated than I'd seen before. "Do you remember being a kid and taking something apart to see how it worked? Like a clock or a radio?"

I nodded.

"That's what music feels like to me. This perfect, complicated mechanism that someone designed to create beauty. When I hear a good song, I want to take it apart and understand why it works—why this chord progression makes you feel sad, or why changing the tempo changes everything." He glanced at me. "Does that make sense?"

"Perfect sense." I thought about how I heard music—the layers I was learning to identify. "Is that why you write the Bayside Boys' arrangements?"

"Yeah. Peter's got good instincts for melodies and lyrics—what sounds catchy, what people want to hear. But turning those ideas into actual songs, with harmonies and structure... that's the part I love. The architecture of it."

"Architecture," I repeated. "I like that. Like building something that didn't exist before."

"Exactly." His smile was quick and warm. "Most people think music just happens, like it springs fully formed from someone's head. But it's construction—careful, deliberate, piece by piece."

We'd reached the quieter part of the boardwalk now, where the shops gave way to residential buildings. The ocean stretched out to our left, dark and vast under the deepening sky.

"What about you?" Nick asked. "What do you love about flowers?"

No one had ever asked me that before. They saw the shop as my mother's business, my father's legacy. My work there was just what I did, not something I'd chosen or loved.

"I like the temporary nature of them," I said slowly, working it out as I spoke. "A bouquet is beautiful for a week, maybe less. You create this perfect thing knowing it won't last, and that makes it more precious somehow. Every arrangement is a moment captured—a celebration or a comfort or a hope. And then it's gone."

Nick looked at me with an expression I couldn't quite read. "That's beautiful. I never thought about it that way."

"Temporary beauty. Flowers and summer and..." I gestured vaguely at the boardwalk, the season, the whole transient magic of it. "All of this, I guess."

We walked a bit further before Nick spoke again. "My family doesn't really get the music thing. They're supportive—they come to performances, they're proud—but they don't understand why I want to study it in college. My dad keeps asking about 'practical degrees' and 'backup plans.'"

"What do you tell him?"

"That music is the backup plan. That everything else would just be marking time until I could get back to what matters." He shrugged. "I don't think he hears me, but at least I'm saying it."

I understood that feeling—being seen but not understood. Mama supported my work at the shop, but I knew she wanted more for me. College, maybe. A career beyond Foster's Flowers. But I'd never told her what I actually wanted, mostly because I didn't know myself.

"Your mother seems nice," Nick said. "She was really kind the night we met."

"She is. She's been raising me alone since my father died, which couldn't have been easy. But she never makes it seem hard." I paused. "She likes you, by the way. She said you seem genuine."

"That's probably the nicest compliment anyone's ever given me." Nick's tone was self-deprecating but pleased. "Most people don't notice me long enough to form opinions."

"The bass singer curse?"

"Something like that."

We'd reached Foster's Flowers, but neither of us stopped walking. We continued past it, taking the longer route through the side streets, neither ready for the conversation to end.

"Can I ask you something now?" Nick said.

"Fair's fair."

"Why did you sign up for the competition? You were terrified of performing, but you did it anyway. What pushed you to try?"

I'd known he'd ask eventually, but I still wasn't sure how to answer honestly without admitting the shallow truth about wanting Peter's attention.

"I was tired of watching," I said finally. "I spent the whole summer coming to performances, standing in the same spot every night, being invisible. The competition felt like a chance to step forward. To be part of something instead of just watching it happen."

"And was it worth it? The terror and the panic and all of it?"

I thought about it carefully. The audition had been the most humiliating experience of my life. But it had also led to this—to afternoon rehearsals at The Melody Box, to evening walks with someone who actually listened, to discovering I could sing in ways I'd never imagined.

"Yes," I said. "It was worth it. Is worth it, I mean. Even though I'm still terrified about the actual performance."

"We'll practice until you're not," Nick said with quiet confidence. "Or at least until the terror is manageable."

We'd looped back around to Foster's Flowers now, and this time we stopped on the sidewalk outside. Upstairs, lights glowed warm in the apartment windows. Mama would be waiting, probably reading in her favorite chair.

"Thank you for walking me home," I said.

"Thanks for letting me." Nick shifted, suddenly looking uncertain. "Same time tomorrow? After the performance?"

"I'd like that."

He smiled, that genuine expression that transformed his serious face into something warmer. "Goodnight, Diane."

"Goodnight, Nick."

I climbed the stairs to the apartment, glancing back once to see him walking away, hands in pockets, heading back toward the boardwalk.

"How was your walk?" Mama asked without looking up from her book.

"Good." I hung up my cardigan. "Nick's really easy to talk to. We talked about music and flowers and our families."

"Sounds like a real conversation."

"It was." I sat on the arm of the couch. "Mama, have you ever noticed how you can talk to someone for hours and still feel like you're saying nothing important, but with someone else, five minutes feels like you've shared something real?"

She set down her book, giving me her full attention. "I have noticed that. Which kind is Nick?"

"The second kind." I considered it. "Definitely the second kind."

"That's rare. Don't take it for granted."

I thought about that as I got ready for bed. In all my weeks of watching Peter perform, I'd never once had a real conversation with him. I'd built an entire fantasy on his smile and his voice and the way he made me feel from a distance. But I didn't actually know him.

Nick, on the other hand—Nick I was beginning to know. His passion for music theory, his quiet confidence, his thoughtful way of listening that made you want to share more than you'd planned.

I picked up my box of performance flyers and looked at the photograph of the Bayside Boys. Peter still looked handsome and charming, exactly the kind of boy every girl should want.

But my eyes kept drifting to Nick in the background, serious and steady, and I felt something shift in my chest. Something that had been pointing one direction all summer slowly, gradually turning toward something different.

Something real.

I tucked the flyer away and turned off the light, but sleep was slow to come. I kept replaying our conversation—the easy flow of it, the way Nick's face lit up when he talked about music, how comfortable the silences felt between us.

Sally had been right. Getting to know Nick was changing everything.

I just wasn't sure yet what it was changing into.
