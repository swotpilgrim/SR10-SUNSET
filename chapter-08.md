# Chapter 8: Unexpected Chemistry

The Melody Box sat tucked between a tailor shop and a candy store, easy to miss. I almost walked past twice before spotting the faded sign.

A bell chimed when I entered, and the smell of old vinyl hit me—nostalgic and comforting.

The shop was cramped and cluttered, records lining every wall. A few listening booths occupied one side. An old Wurlitzer jukebox glowed in the corner, silent.

"Be right with you!" a voice called from the back.

I stood just inside, suddenly nervous. What if I froze in practice like I had at the audition?

An elderly man emerged, wiping his hands on a cloth. White hair, kind eyes, warm smile.

"Welcome to The Melody Box. Looking for anything particular—" He stopped, studying my face. "Ah, you must be Diane. Nick said you'd be coming by this afternoon."

"Yes, that's me." I relaxed slightly at his friendly manner. "You must be Mr. Gennaro."

"The very same. Nick's in back—second door on the left."

I made my way past shelves of records to the back room. The door stood ajar.

I knocked softly. "Nick?"

"Come in."

The back room was small, clearly used for storage. Nick had pushed boxes aside to create an open space. Two chairs faced each other, and a record player sat ready on a cleared shelf.

Nick was sorting through 45s. He looked up and smiled.

"You found it okay?"

"Eventually. I walked past twice."

"That keeps out the tourists." He gestured to a chair. "Have a seat. Want something to drink?"

"I'm okay, thank you."

I sat, folding my hands to keep them from fidgeting. Nick took the other chair. I was struck by how different he seemed from Peter—no performance energy or practiced charm. Just quiet, steady presence.

"So," he said, "how are you feeling about all this?"

"Terrified," I admitted. "You?"

"Curious." He leaned back in his chair, relaxed in a way I envied. "I've never performed a featured duet before. Usually I'm just foundation for the others."

"You're always foundation," I said without thinking. Then caught myself. "I mean—that's what bass singers do, right? Hold everything together?"

"Yeah. That's the role." Something flickered in his expression—not quite sadness, but maybe... resignation? "It's a good role. Important. But not exactly spotlight material."

"Is that why you agreed to step forward? During my audition?" The question had been bothering me since Sally told me we'd won. "To get a chance at the spotlight?"

Nick considered this, his dark eyes thoughtful. "No. I stepped forward because you looked like you were about to run, and I didn't want you to miss your chance because of fear. The spotlight thing..." He shrugged. "That's just what happened after."

His honesty made me feel small for assuming ulterior motives. "Well, thank you. Again. I know I keep saying it, but I mean it."

"I know you do." He reached for the stack of records. "Ready to actually practice? Or do you need more time to be nervous?"

I laughed despite myself. "I think I'll be nervous no matter how much time you give me."

"Fair enough." He selected a record and placed it carefully on the turntable. "I thought we'd start with the song we did at auditions—the romantic ballad. You know it already, and we've performed it together once, so there's some foundation to build on."

"Foundation," I echoed. "Is that bass singer talk for 'we didn't completely embarrass ourselves'?"

"Exactly." His smile was quick and genuine.

He set the needle on the record, and the familiar opening notes filled the small room. But instead of starting immediately, Nick held up his hand.

"Just listen first. Hear the structure. The instrumental's doing what the full band would do in a live performance—but for our duet, it'll just be the four of us providing harmonies. No instruments."

I listened, trying to hear what he heard. The melody line, the rhythm, the spaces where voices would enter and blend.

"Peter carries the lead melody," Nick explained, his voice low under the music. "Tommy and Joey fill in the tenor and mid-range harmonies. My bass line provides the foundation. Your soprano would normally double Peter's melody an octave up, adding brightness. But during the audition, you followed my bass line instead."

"Because I was panicking and your voice was the only thing I could hold onto," I admitted.

"Maybe. But it created something interesting. Your soprano against my bass—it left this space in the middle that Peter's lead filled differently. Made the whole structure more open, more... emotional, somehow."

I listened to the record with fresh ears, trying to imagine what he described.

"So for the actual performance," Nick continued, "I think we should keep that arrangement. Let you follow the bass line while Peter leads. It's unconventional, but it worked."

The record ended, and Nick lifted the needle. "Ready to try?"

My stomach clenched with anxiety, but I nodded.

Nick stood and moved to stand a few feet away from me, close enough to hear each other clearly but not crowding. He counted us in softly.

"One, two, three—"

His bass voice started the opening line, deep and steady. The sound filled the small room, wrapping around me like a blanket.

I took a breath and joined in, my soprano tentative at first. But without the crowd, without the pressure of performance, my voice came easier. I followed Nick's bass line like I had during the audition, letting him lead while I built harmonies on top.

We sang through the first verse, and it felt... good. Not perfect—my voice wavered in a few places, and I came in late on one phrase. But it felt possible.

When we finished, Nick nodded approvingly. "That's good. Really good. You've got natural instinct for harmony. Your voice finds the right notes even when you're nervous."

"Years of listening to the radio," I said, trying to deflect the compliment.

"It's more than that. You hear music the way I do—not just the surface melody but the layers underneath." He rewound the record. "Again? And this time, try to breathe with me. We'll breathe at the same points, which will help us stay synchronized."

We ran through the song three more times, and with each repetition, I felt myself relaxing incrementally. Nick was patient, offering gentle corrections about breathing or phrasing, never making me feel inadequate.

"You're a good teacher," I said during a water break. "Is that part of being a bass singer too?"

"Actually, yeah. Bass singers usually have to know everyone else's parts because we're listening to everything, making sure it all fits together. You can't provide good foundation if you don't understand what you're supporting."

I thought about that—about how much work went into being the one nobody noticed. "Don't you ever want to be the lead? To be the one in front getting the attention?"

Nick leaned against the wall, considering. "Sometimes. But that's not really my strength. I'm better at seeing how all the pieces fit together, at creating structure for others to shine within." He paused. "That probably sounds boring."

"It sounds essential."

Something in his expression softened. "Not many people see it that way."

"Maybe they're not paying attention to the right things."

We looked at each other for a moment, and I felt a connection forming—something built on music and mutual understanding rather than surface attraction.

"Let's try it one more time," Nick said, pushing off the wall. "And this time, I want you to trust yourself more. Your instincts are good, Diane. Stop second-guessing every note."

The next run-through was our best yet. My voice grew stronger, more confident. I stopped thinking about hitting the right notes and just let the music flow through me. Nick's bass provided the anchor, and I soared above it, our voices interweaving in a way that felt almost effortless.

When the last note faded, we stood in silence for a moment, the echo of our harmonies hanging in the air.

"That," Nick said quietly, "is why Peter chose us."

I felt something bloom in my chest—not quite pride, but maybe its quieter cousin. Satisfaction. Hope.

"I can't believe we actually sounded good," I whispered.

"We did. We do." He started gathering up the records. "Same time next week? We should practice at least once a week until the show."

"Okay." I helped him straighten the chairs. "Nick? Thank you. For being patient with me. For not making me feel stupid about being scared."

"Fear doesn't make you stupid. It makes you human." He looked at me directly, his dark eyes serious. "And for what it's worth, I'm scared too. I've never been anything but background before. Being featured is... different."

Knowing he was nervous too made me feel less alone. "We'll figure it out together?"

"Yeah. Together."

I left The Melody Box feeling lighter than I had in days. The walk back to Foster's Flowers took me past the boardwalk, where tourists and locals enjoyed the afternoon sunshine. Somewhere in the distance, I could hear music playing—a jukebox or a radio, the soundtrack to summer in Bayshore.

When I got home, Mama looked up from arranging a bridal bouquet.

"How did it go?"

"Good." I leaned against the counter, smiling. "It went really good, actually. Nick's an excellent teacher, and we sounded... we sounded right together."

"That's wonderful, honey." She studied my face. "You look happier than you have in weeks."

Did I? I thought about it and realized she was right. The constant anxiety that had been riding my shoulders since the competition announcement had eased slightly. Not gone—I was still terrified of the actual performance. But the panic had been replaced with something more like anticipation.

That night at the Bayside Boys' performance, I watched with new understanding. I saw how Nick shaped the group's sound from his position at the back, how his bass line held everything together, how the others relied on him even if the crowd didn't notice.

And when Peter sang the romantic ballad, I didn't feel the usual flutter in my chest. Instead, I found myself appreciating the craftsmanship of the arrangement, the way all four voices created something larger than their individual parts.

After the show, Nick caught my eye as the group packed up. He gave me a small nod—a private acknowledgment of our afternoon together, of the partnership we were building.

I nodded back, and for the first time since signing up for that audition, I thought maybe this would actually work out.

Maybe I could do this impossible thing.

Maybe, with Nick beside me, I could actually step into the spotlight without falling apart.

Maybe.
