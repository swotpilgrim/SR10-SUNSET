# Chapter 3: The Bass Singer Notices

The afternoon heat shimmered off the boardwalk planks as I made my way toward the bandstand earlier than usual. Mama had given me a few hours off—business was slow on Wednesday afternoons, and she'd practically shooed me out the door, saying I'd been working too hard and needed fresh air.

I knew where my feet would take me before I even left the shop.

The bandstand stood empty in the afternoon sun, its white paint bright against the blue sky. But voices drifted from behind it, and I slowed my approach, suddenly aware I was intruding on something not meant for spectators.

The Bayside Boys were running through a sound check.

I hesitated at the edge of the gathering area, half-hidden behind the cotton candy stand that wouldn't open for another hour. I should leave. This wasn't a performance—this was work, preparation, the behind-the-scenes moment that broke the magic of the evening shows.

But I couldn't make myself walk away.

"Again from the bridge," someone called out. Peter's voice, I thought, though without the microphone it sounded more ordinary. "Tommy, you're coming in a beat too early."

"I'm following Joey!" Tommy protested.

"Joey's rushing." This voice was deeper, quieter. "We need to breathe before the harmony shift."

They started again, singing a cappella. Without the instrumental backing track, their voices were naked and raw—beautiful still, but human. I heard the individual parts more clearly: Peter's lead melody soaring on top, Tommy's tenor harmony weaving through the middle, Joey's mid-range support, and underneath it all, that deep bass line that held everything together.

The bass singer. I still didn't know his name, and the realization embarrassed me. I'd been watching these performances for weeks, collecting their flyers, dreaming about Peter—but I'd never bothered to learn the other members' names beyond Tommy and Joey, which I'd only picked up from overheard conversations.

I edged closer, using the cotton candy stand as cover, and peered around its striped awning.

The four of them stood in a loose circle on the bandstand, dressed casually in rolled-up jeans and t-shirts, so different from their performance uniforms. Peter stood in the center gesturing as he talked, clearly leading the discussion. Tommy and Joey flanked him, nodding along.

The bass singer stood slightly apart, arms crossed, watching the others with an expression I couldn't quite read.

"Let's run it once more," Peter said. "From the top."

They arranged themselves in performance formation—Peter front and center, the others in their usual positions. The bass singer moved to the back, and I noticed for the first time how he seemed to disappear when he stepped into that spot, becoming part of the background even though his voice was essential to the sound.

He raised his hand to count them in, his fingers marking the beat in the air. One, two, three—

Their voices blended together, and even in the broad daylight with no crowd and no evening magic, the sound was beautiful. I closed my eyes and listened, picking out the individual parts, hearing how they wove together.

The bass line anchored everything. Peter's melody would have floated away without it, too sweet and untethered. But that deep voice underneath gave the song weight and foundation, turned it from pretty into meaningful.

When they finished, I opened my eyes and found the bass singer looking directly at me.

My breath caught. Had he seen me the whole time? How long had he known I was there?

He didn't look angry or even surprised. Just thoughtful, his dark eyes steady on my face. I felt heat flood my cheeks and started to back away, ready to flee from my obvious eavesdropping.

But he'd already looked away, turning back to the others as Peter called for another run-through of a different song.

I stood frozen for a moment longer, my heart racing from the brief eye contact. Then I forced myself to walk away before I embarrassed myself further. My saddle shoes made soft sounds against the boardwalk, and I didn't look back.

That evening, I returned to the bandstand at my usual time. The crowd was smaller than normal—Wednesday nights never drew the same numbers as weekends—but my spot on the left side was still available. I claimed it and waited, trying not to think about that moment when the bass singer had caught me watching.

The Bayside Boys took the stage in their matching performance outfits, all traces of the casual afternoon rehearsal erased. Peter stepped to the microphone with his practiced smile, and the show began.

I tried to focus on Peter the way I always did, but my attention kept drifting to the back of the stage. To the bass singer who stood in shadow, his face serious as he provided the foundation for every song.

Had he told the others about seeing me that afternoon? Were they laughing about the silly girl who couldn't even wait for the actual performance, who had to creep around watching their rehearsals like some kind of obsessed fan?

The thought made my stomach clench with embarrassment.

But as the performance continued, nothing seemed different. Peter performed with his usual charm, the harmonies were tight and perfect, and nobody even glanced in my direction with recognition or amusement.

Maybe the bass singer hadn't mentioned it. Maybe it didn't matter enough to bring up.

During the second song, I found myself watching him more closely. He didn't move around like Peter did, didn't play to the crowd or make eye contact with the audience. He simply stood in his position and sang, his deep voice steady and sure, the anchor that kept everything from drifting apart.

There was something almost lonely about it—being so essential but so invisible. Everyone watched Peter. Even I watched Peter, despite knowing now how much that bass line mattered.

The romantic ballad started, and Peter's voice dropped into that intimate register that made hearts flutter. Around me, girls sighed and leaned forward. I closed my eyes, trying to recapture the magic I usually felt during this song.

But tonight, I heard it differently. I heard the structure—how Peter's melody was beautiful but simple, and how the bass line underneath gave it complexity and depth. I heard how the tenor and mid-range harmonies filled the space between, and how all of it only worked because that foundation was solid.

The afternoon rehearsal had pulled back the curtain, and I couldn't unsee what I'd learned.

The song ended, and the crowd applauded. I clapped along, but my enthusiasm felt muted. Not because the performance wasn't good—it was perfect, as always. But something had shifted in how I heard it.

After the third song, Peter thanked the crowd and the Bayside Boys descended from the stage. The usual cluster of admirers formed around Peter, and I stayed in my spot, watching from a distance.

Tommy and Joey packed up equipment. The bass singer coiled cables with the same methodical precision I'd noticed before. He worked efficiently, his movements economical, like someone who'd done this task a hundred times.

"Nick! A little help here?" Joey called, struggling with the record player.

Nick. So that was his name.

Nick set down the cables and crossed to help Joey, lifting the heavy equipment with ease. They worked together in comfortable silence, the kind that spoke of long familiarity.

I watched Nick—now that I had a name to attach to the face—and wondered what it was like to be the foundation everyone built on but nobody noticed. Did it bother him? Or was he content being essential but invisible?

The crowd dispersed slowly. I should leave too, head home before Mama started worrying. But I lingered, watching the Bayside Boys finish their pack-up routine.

Peter was still surrounded by admirers, his laughter carrying across the evening air. Barbara Wellington stood at his elbow, her hand possessive on his arm. He didn't seem to mind.

Nick finished packing the last of the equipment and straightened, brushing his hands on his slacks. For just a moment, his eyes swept across the remaining crowd, and I thought—maybe imagined—that his gaze paused on me.

But then Tommy said something to him, and Nick turned away, and the moment passed.

I walked home slowly, my mind full of thoughts I couldn't quite organize. About Peter's charm and Nick's foundation. About being seen and being essential. About the difference between what shines on the surface and what holds everything together underneath.

"How was the performance?" Mama asked when I came upstairs.

"Good," I said automatically. Then, more thoughtfully, "Different."

She looked up from her knitting. "Different how?"

I struggled to explain. "I noticed things I hadn't before. How the music works. The parts that make it whole."

Mama smiled. "That's called listening instead of just hearing."

I thought about that as I got ready for bed. Listening instead of hearing. Seeing instead of just looking.

Maybe that's what I'd been doing all summer—looking at Peter without really seeing him. Hearing the surface melody without listening to the deeper structure.

And maybe—just maybe—there was more worth noticing in the shadows than I'd ever realized.

In the darkness of my bedroom, I replayed the moment when Nick had looked at me during the afternoon rehearsal. Not with Peter's practiced charm or performative interest, but with a steady, thoughtful attention that made me feel actually seen.

It should have been embarrassing, being caught watching where I didn't belong.

Instead, it had felt like the first real moment of connection I'd experienced all summer.

I rolled over and closed my eyes, but sleep was slow to come. My mind kept drifting back to the bandstand, to afternoon rehearsals and evening performances, to lead singers and bass singers, to the difference between shine and substance.

And to the quiet realization that maybe, just maybe, I'd been looking in the wrong direction this whole time.
