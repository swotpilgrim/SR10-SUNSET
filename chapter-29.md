# Chapter 29: The Last Day of Summer

Labor Day Monday arrived with gray skies and the promise of rain. The end of summer weather, Mama called it—when the season finally admits defeat and makes room for autumn.

I stood at my bedroom window watching the empty boardwalk below. Gone were the crowds of tourists and the constant hum of activity. The vendors had packed up their carts. The arcade stood dark and silent. Even the ocean looked different somehow—less playful, more serious, preparing itself for the colder months ahead.

The doorbell rang, and I knew without looking that it was Nick.

"Morning," he said when I opened the door, his smile warming me despite the chill in the air. "Ready for our last day of summer?"

"Is it really the last day? Technically summer doesn't end until—"

"Labor Day is the last day that counts," he interrupted gently. "Tomorrow everything changes. School starts next week. Tourists are gone. Boardwalk shuts down except for locals." He took my hand. "Today is the end of the magic."

"Then we better make it count."

We walked through the quiet town, our footsteps echoing on the empty boardwalk. It felt strange—almost eerie—to see it so deserted after months of constant activity. Like walking through a ghost town, all the life and energy drained away overnight.

"It's sad," I said. "Seeing it like this."

"Yeah." Nick squeezed my hand. "But it's also kind of beautiful. Like we have the whole place to ourselves."

He was right. There was something intimate about the empty boardwalk, something private. For months we'd shared this space with thousands of people. Now it belonged to just us.

We ended up at the bandstand where it had all begun. The stage stood empty, the microphones packed away, no crowd gathered to listen. But I could still hear the music in my head—the Bayside Boys' harmonies, Nick's bass line holding everything together, my voice joining his in that fateful duet.

"Want to sing?" Nick asked suddenly.

"Here? Now?"

"Why not? No audience to make you nervous. Just us and the empty boardwalk." He climbed onto the stage and offered me his hand. "Come on. One last performance for summer."

I hesitated only a moment before taking his hand and letting him pull me up onto the familiar stage. It felt different without the lights and microphones, without the crowd pressing close. Smaller somehow. More real.

"What should we sing?" I asked.

Nick thought for a moment, then smiled. "The song from the audition. The one where we first sang together."

"I don't remember all the words."

"Doesn't matter. Just follow my lead."

He started the bass line a cappella, his voice filling the empty space with that same steady foundation that had saved me all those weeks ago. And just like the first time, I found my harmony above it, our voices weaving together in the familiar pattern.

Without the band, without the production, it was just our two voices and the sound of waves in the distance. Pure and simple and somehow more beautiful for it.

When the last note faded, we stood there in silence, the gray sky pressing down above us, the boardwalk stretching empty in all directions.

"I'm going to miss this," I said quietly. "Not just summer, but... this version of us. When everything felt possible and new."

"We're still new," Nick pointed out. "We've only been officially together for two days."

"I know, but everything is about to change. School starting, routines changing, the magic of summer ending..."

"Diane." He turned to face me fully, taking both my hands. "Listen to me. The magic wasn't the summer. It wasn't the boardwalk or the performances or any of that. The magic is us. How we sound together. How we make each other brave. That doesn't end just because the season changes."

"How do you know?"

"Because real magic doesn't need perfect weather and tourist crowds to exist. It just needs two people who choose each other, every day, even when it's gray and raining and all the pretty summer trappings are gone." He pulled me closer. "I choose you on boring Tuesdays just as much as on perfect beach days. That's the difference between summer romance and real love."

Real love. He'd said it so casually, but the words hit me with unexpected force.

"You love me," I said, not quite a question.

"Yeah." His dark eyes met mine, completely open. "I love you. I thought that was pretty clear after Saturday night's confession, but I'll say it again if you need to hear it. I love you, Diane Foster. Summer, fall, winter, spring—doesn't matter. I love you."

My eyes filled with tears. "I love you too. So much that it scares me sometimes."

"Good scared?"

"The best kind of scared."

He kissed me then, soft and gentle, and I tasted rain—the first drops starting to fall from the gray sky above us.

"We should probably get out of the rain," Nick said when we broke apart, but neither of us moved.

"Or we could stay right here," I suggested. "Dance in it like people do in movies."

"You want to dance in the rain on an empty boardwalk?"

"Why not? Last day of summer. Might as well make it memorable."

Nick laughed, that genuine laugh I loved so much. "You're ridiculous and perfect."

"Is that a yes?"

Instead of answering, he pulled me into a dance position—one hand at my waist, the other holding mine—and started humming a slow melody. The rain fell harder now, soaking through our clothes, but neither of us cared.

We swayed together on the empty bandstand, no music except Nick's humming and the sound of rain on wood, and it was perfect. Absolutely perfect.

"I want to remember this," I said against his chest. "This exact moment. You and me and the rain and the empty boardwalk. The last day of summer."

"We'll have a lot of moments to remember," Nick promised. "This is just the first of many."

The rain intensified, and finally we had to admit defeat. We ran from the bandstand, laughing and soaked, taking shelter under the awning of Foster's Flowers.

"You're completely drenched," I said, water dripping from Nick's hair onto his nose.

"So are you. Mama's going to kill you for running around in the rain."

"Worth it."

He kissed me again, rainwater mixing with the kiss, both of us shivering slightly from the cold but warm where we touched.

"Come inside," I said. "We can dry off. Maybe I can make us some tea."

Mama was in the shop, arranging a late-season bouquet, and she shook her head when she saw us dripping in the doorway.

"I should have known," she said, but she was smiling. "There are towels in the back, and I just made fresh coffee. Go dry off before you both catch pneumonia."

We spent the afternoon in the shop, helping Mama with arrangements, drinking coffee, talking about everything and nothing. The rain continued outside, washing the summer away, preparing the world for autumn.

At one point, I looked up from the roses I was trimming to find Nick watching me with an expression of such tenderness it made my breath catch.

"What?" I asked.

"Nothing. Just... I like this. Being here with you, doing normal things. It's nice."

"Better than performing?"

"Different from performing." He came around the worktable to stand beside me. "Performing is exciting, but this is... real. This is life. And I like our life together."

Our life together. As if it was already established, already a certainty.

Maybe it was.

When the rain finally stopped in the late afternoon, we walked to The Melody Box one last time. Mr. Gennaro was closing up for the season—he only stayed open year-round for locals, cutting his hours drastically after Labor Day.

"Ah, the lovebirds!" he called when he saw us. "Come to say goodbye to summer?"

"Something like that," Nick said.

We spent an hour listening to records in the back room, Mr. Gennaro pulling out his favorites and explaining the history behind each one. He told us about seeing Billie Holiday perform in New York, about the first time he heard Ella Fitzgerald, about the record store he'd dreamed of owning since he was a boy.

"Music connects us across time," he said. "The records I'm playing for you now—they're the same songs I listened to when I was your age, falling in love for the first time. And someday you'll play these same songs for your children, and the music will still be true."

It felt significant somehow—this passing down of music and love and stories. Like we were part of something bigger than just our own small romance.

As the sun started to set—breaking through the clouds for a final burst of gold before night—Nick walked me home one last time in summer.

"Tomorrow everything changes," I said.

"Tomorrow we start a new chapter," Nick corrected. "That's different from ending."

"New chapter?"

"Think about it. Summer was Act One—meeting, falling in love, figuring out who we are together. Fall will be Act Two—learning how to be together in real life, with school and responsibilities and all that. And then winter, spring, next summer... the story just keeps going."

"I like that better than ending."

"Me too."

At my door, he kissed me goodnight—longer than usual, sweeter, like he was trying to memorize the moment.

"Tomorrow I'll pick you up after school," he said. "We'll start our fall routine."

"Walk me home?"

"Every single day."

I watched him leave, his figure disappearing into the twilight, and felt a bittersweet ache in my chest. Summer really was over. The magic days of boardwalk performances and warm nights and tourist crowds—all gone now, packed away for another year.

But Nick was right. The real magic wasn't the summer. It was us. It was choosing each other, day after day, through all the seasons.

Inside, Mama was waiting with dinner and questions about my day. I told her about dancing in the rain, about the empty boardwalk, about Nick saying he loved me in the gray morning light.

"He's a good boy," Mama said. "Your father would have liked him."

"Yeah," I agreed, smiling. "He really would have."

That night, I lay in bed listening to the record Mr. Gennaro had given us—Ella and Louis singing together, their voices creating magic across decades. And I thought about how music really does connect us across time, how love stories repeat themselves in new forms, how the same songs can mean different things to different generations but still carry the same truth.

Summer was over.

But our story was just beginning.
