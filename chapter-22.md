# Chapter 22: Confronting the Truth

Friday morning dawned clear and bright. I woke early, my mind spinning with thoughts I'd been avoiding all summer. Tomorrow was Saturday—one day before the final performance. One day left to get my head straight.

I lay in bed and forced myself to think through everything chronologically. Fourth of July weekend. The first time I'd seen the Bayside Boys. Peter stepping to that microphone, all charisma and charm, and me deciding he was exactly what I wanted. The fantasy that felt safe because it would never be real.

Except it had become real. And it had been empty. Hollow.

I moved to my window, looking down at the quiet morning street. Foster's Flowers below, the boardwalk stretching toward the ocean.

This whole complicated mess I'd made of my own heart.

I thought about Nick stepping forward during my audition. That moment when I'd been frozen with terror and he'd just appeared beside me, his bass voice creating a foundation I could build on. He hadn't done it for recognition or reward. He'd done it because I needed help and he could give it.

That's who Nick was. Someone who stepped forward when people needed him, even when it meant no one would notice his contribution. Someone who created beauty from the shadows and never demanded credit for it.

And I'd spent weeks walking beside him, falling for him without realizing it—while still fixated on Peter. On the fantasy. On the safe choice that required nothing from me.

Because that's what Peter represented. Safety. Distance. A crush from afar that could never truly hurt me.

But Nick required vulnerability. Being with Nick meant letting him see all of me—the scared parts, the imperfect parts I usually kept hidden. That was terrifying.

So I'd run. Chased Peter even after Nick became important, because fantasy was familiar and real was unknown.

Then Peter asked me out, and I'd said yes without thinking. Cancelled plans with Nick's family—his family—for a date with someone I didn't even want.

My stomach churned with shame. No wonder Nick pulled away. No wonder he needed time.

I'd shown him he was second choice. Consolation prize.

Even though that wasn't true. Even though I'd been falling for him all along.

I showered and dressed for work, my mind continuing to process. At breakfast, Mama took one look at my face and poured an extra cup of coffee.

"You've been thinking," she observed.

"Too much, probably." I cradled the mug, letting its warmth seep into my hands. "I've been such a coward, Mama."

"How so?"

"Peter was safe. A crush I could control from a distance. But Nick..." I struggled for words. "Nick sees me. Really sees me. And that's scary because what if he sees all of me and decides I'm not enough?"

Mama set down her own cup. "And is that fair to him? Assuming he'll reject you before giving him the chance to know you?"

"No. It's not fair at all." I stared into my coffee. "I've been so focused on protecting myself that I hurt the one person who never tried to hurt me. Who only ever tried to help me."

"So what are you going to do about it?"

"Tell him the truth. All of it. Not just that I'm sorry, but why I was so blind. Why I kept running toward Peter even after Nick became important to me." I looked up at her. "He deserves to understand what was actually happening. That it wasn't about him not being enough. It was about me being too scared to let myself have something real."

"That takes courage."

"I know. But he's worth it."

The day at Foster's Flowers passed in a meditative haze. I arranged bouquets, my hands moving through familiar motions while my mind organized my feelings. Each stem placed, each bloom trimmed—like cutting away pretense.

By six o'clock, I knew exactly what I needed to say.

The boardwalk was crowded when I arrived. I found my spot and waited, my heart steady.

The Bayside Boys took the stage, and I watched Nick with clear eyes. Really seeing him. The serious set of his shoulders. The careful precision. The quiet confidence that came from knowing his worth even when no one acknowledged it.

God, I loved him.

The clarity of it hit me fresh. I loved Nick Romano. Loved his gentle strength, his patient teaching, his generous heart. Loved that being with him required me to be brave.

I loved him, and I'd almost lost him through my own cowardice.

The performance ended with enthusiastic applause. Peter took his final bow with characteristic flair. The crowd began dispersing, and I stayed in my spot, watching Nick pack up equipment.

He glanced over once, saw me standing there, and quickly looked away. But not before I saw something in his expression—not quite hope, but maybe the ghost of it.

I started toward him, but Barbara Wellington intercepted me, her smile sharp.

"You know, Peter's been telling everyone how you turned out to be kind of a cold fish."

A week ago, that would have stung. Now I just looked at her with pity.

"Peter's entitled to his opinion," I said calmly. "Excuse me."

I stepped around her toward Nick. He had his back to me, shoulders tight with tension.

"Nick?"

He turned slowly, his expression carefully neutral. "Hey."

"Can we talk? Please? I know you need space, and I'm not trying to push, but I need to tell you something. Something important."

He studied my face for a long moment, then nodded. "Okay. Let's walk."

We left the boardwalk for quieter residential streets. The evening sun painted everything gold.

For a while, we walked in silence. I gathered my thoughts, organizing them like I'd organized flowers all day.

"I need to explain something," I said finally. "About this whole summer. About Peter and you and why I was so blind for so long."

Nick kept his eyes forward but I saw his jaw tighten. "You don't have to—"

"I do, though. Because you deserve to understand what was really happening. That it was never about you not being enough." I took a breath. "Peter was safe. A fantasy I could control from a distance. I could crush on him without risking anything real because it would never happen. And even if it did happen, I wouldn't have to be truly vulnerable because he'd never actually see me. Just the surface. The performance version."

Nick's steps slowed slightly, but he didn't interrupt.

"But you? Nick, you're terrifying. Because you actually see me. Not just the good parts or the parts I choose to show. All of me. The awkward flower shop girl who freezes on stage. The one who hides behind safe crushes because real connection is scary. The one who's spent years being invisible and doesn't know how to let herself be seen."

I stopped walking, and he stopped too, finally turning to face me. His expression was still guarded but softening at the edges.

"I wasn't chasing Peter because he was better," I continued. "I was running from you because you're real. Because being with you requires me to be vulnerable and honest and brave—all the things that terrify me. Fantasy is safe. It can't hurt me."

"But I can hurt you," Nick said quietly. "Is that what you're saying?"

"You can. Because you matter. Because what we have is real, and real things come with risk." I moved closer. "Peter could never hurt me because I never actually cared about him. Not really. I cared about the idea of him, the validation of being noticed by the handsome lead singer. But I never cared about him as a person."

Nick was quiet, processing this.

"When I went on that date with Peter, I wasn't choosing him over you. I was choosing fantasy over reality. Safety over risk. Comfortable dishonesty over terrifying honesty." I met his eyes directly. "And the minute I actually sat across from him and tried to have a real conversation, I realized how hollow it all was. That I'd spent all summer chasing something that didn't exist while ignoring what was actually real."

"Which was what?" His voice was barely above a whisper.

"You. Us. This thing between us that's scary and real and worth being brave for." I reached for his hand. "I'm not asking you to trust me immediately. I know I have to earn that back. But I needed you to understand—you were never second choice. You were the choice I was too afraid to make until I ran out of places to hide."

Nick's thumb brushed across my knuckles, a gesture so achingly familiar it made my throat tight.

"You really mean that?"

"Every word. I love you, Nick. Not because Peter disappointed me. Not because you're convenient or safe or the easy option. I love you because you make me want to be braver than I am. Because being with you feels like the most honest thing I've ever done. Because you see me—really see me—and somehow you still want me anyway."

His other hand came up to cup my face, and I saw tears shining in his eyes.

"I see you because you're worth seeing," he said. "Every part of you, Diane. The scared parts and the brave parts and everything in between."

"Even when I'm an idiot who chases the wrong things?"

"Especially then." He smiled, small but real. "We all chase the wrong things sometimes. The important part is figuring it out and finding your way back."

"Have I found my way back?"

Instead of answering, he kissed me. Soft and sweet and full of forgiveness I wasn't sure I'd earned yet.

"You're getting there," he murmured against my lips. "We're getting there together."

We stood there as evening deepened around us, holding each other on a quiet street corner, and I felt something shift. Not back to how things were before—we couldn't go back—but forward into something new. Something built on honesty instead of fantasy. On vulnerability instead of safety.

Something real.

"One more day until the performance," Nick said eventually.

"I know. Are you ready?"

"With you beside me? I think I am." He tucked a strand of hair behind my ear. "We're going to be okay, Diane. Not perfect, not always easy. But okay."

"Okay is good. Okay is real."

"Yeah." He kissed my forehead. "It is."

We walked the rest of the way to my building hand in hand, and when we said goodnight, it felt like a beginning instead of an ending.

Like maybe, finally, I'd stopped running toward the wrong things and started moving toward what I actually wanted.

Toward something real. Something brave.

Toward him.
