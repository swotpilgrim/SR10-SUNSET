# Chapter 30: The Foundation That Holds

**Two weeks later**

The boardwalk on a Tuesday afternoon in September looked nothing like summer. Half the shops were shuttered. The arcade opened only on weekends. Even the ocean seemed quieter.

But The Melody Box's familiar sign still glowed warm, and that's where I headed after school.

Nick was already inside, sitting in the back room with Mr. Gennaro, listening to a jazz record. When he saw me, his whole face lit up.

"Hey," he said, standing to kiss my cheek. "How was school?"

"Long. Boring. But better now."

Mr. Gennaro smiled and excused himself to help a customer, leaving us alone with the music.

"This is becoming our routine," I observed. "Every Tuesday and Thursday, here in the back room with the records."

"Do you mind?"

"Are you kidding? It's my favorite part of the week."

Since school had started, we'd fallen into new rhythms. Nick walked me home every day. We studied together in the flower shop. On Tuesdays and Thursdays, we came to The Melody Box. On weekends, we walked the quiet boardwalk or sat on my porch talking for hours.

Different from summer—quieter, more grounded—but no less magical.

"I have something to show you," Nick said, pulling a folded piece of paper from his pocket. "I've been working on a new song. For us."

I unfolded the paper to find lyrics in Nick's handwriting. The song was called "Four Seasons"—about a love that changes with the weather but never fades.

"Nick, this is beautiful," I said. "Have you written music for it?"

"Not yet. I was hoping we could write it together. Your melody with my harmony."

"I've never written a song before."

"Neither had I until this summer. But then I met you, and suddenly I couldn't stop writing." He took my hand. "You inspire me, Diane. You make me want to be better. To step out of the background."

"You were always meant for the spotlight. I just helped you see it."

"We help each other see things." He leaned forward. "That's what I love most about us. We make each other braver."

The record in the background shifted to a new song—something slow and romantic that fit the moment perfectly.

"Do you ever miss it?" I asked. "The Bayside Boys, performing every night, the crowds?"

Nick considered the question. "Sometimes. But I like this better. Making music because we love it. Writing our own songs. Building something that's ours."

"We could still perform," I suggested. "School concerts, church events..."

"Would you want to?"

"With you? Yes. Absolutely." I squeezed his hand. "I'm not afraid of the stage anymore. You taught me my voice matters."

"You always had something worth sharing. You just needed to believe it."

The customer in the front left, and Mr. Gennaro reappeared with three cups of coffee on a tray.

"I thought you two might want some refreshment," he said, setting the tray down. "And perhaps you'd like to hear my news?"

"What news?" Nick asked.

Mr. Gennaro's eyes twinkled. "I've been thinking about starting a music program. Here at the shop. Teaching young people about music history, music theory, vocal technique. And I was hoping you two might be interested in helping me. Perhaps teaching some of the vocal harmony classes?"

Nick and I exchanged glances.

"You want us to teach?" I asked, incredulous.

"Why not? You have natural talent, both of you. And more importantly, you understand the heart of music—how it connects people, how it tells stories, how it changes lives." He sipped his coffee. "Think about it. You don't have to answer now."

After he left us alone again, I turned to Nick with wide eyes.

"Could we actually do that? Teach harmony classes?"

"I don't see why not. We know how our voices work together. We could teach other people to find that same kind of connection." He looked excited now, ideas clearly forming. "We could start with the basics—teaching people to hear different voice parts, to find their own range, to blend with others..."

"This is really happening, isn't it?" I said wonderingly. "We're actually building a life together. Not just dating, but creating something. Making plans for the future."

"Does that scare you?"

"Terrifies me," I admitted. "But in the best way. The way that means it matters."

Nick stood and pulled me to my feet, wrapping his arms around me in the empty back room of The Melody Box, surrounded by decades of music pressed into vinyl.

"I love you," he said simply. "I know we're young and it's only been a few months and people will probably say we're moving too fast or taking things too seriously. But I don't care. I love you, and I want to build a life with you. This life—teaching music together, writing songs together, helping other people find their harmony."

Tears pricked my eyes. "I love you too. So much."

"Then let's do it. Let's say yes to Mr. Gennaro. Let's teach harmony classes and write our song together and see where this takes us."

"Okay." I smiled through my tears. "Yes. Let's build something beautiful."

We sealed the agreement with a kiss, and when we broke apart, the record had shifted to Ella and Louis—the album Mr. Gennaro had given us that night after our first kiss. Their voices wove together in perfect harmony, soprano and bass creating something neither could achieve alone.

Just like us.

That evening, Nick walked me home as the September sun set earlier now, painting the sky in shades of gold and amber. The boardwalk was nearly empty, just a few locals out for evening strolls, but it didn't feel lonely anymore. It felt peaceful. Right.

At my door, he pulled me close for a goodnight kiss that lasted longer than usual.

"Same time tomorrow?" he asked.

"Always."

Inside, I found Mama arranging fall flowers—chrysanthemums and asters in warm autumn colors.

"Good day?" she asked without looking up.

"Perfect day." I sat down at the worktable, picking up stems to help with the arrangement. "Mr. Gennaro offered Nick and me a job teaching harmony classes at The Melody Box."

Mama glanced up, eyebrows raised. "That's wonderful, honey. Are you going to take it?"

"We said yes. Or we will say yes officially. But yes."

"Your father would be so proud," Mama said softly. "His little girl, teaching others to find their voice. Making music and building a life with a good boy who loves her."

"Nick is pretty great," I agreed, smiling.

"He is. And you're pretty great together." Mama returned to her flowers. "That's the secret, you know. Finding someone who makes you more yourself, not less. Someone who brings out the best parts and helps you work on the rough edges. You and Nick—you do that for each other."

I thought about that as I helped with the arrangements. Nick did make me more myself. With him, I didn't have to perform or pretend or be anything except exactly who I was. And somehow, being seen that completely made me braver, bolder, more willing to try things I'd once thought impossible.

Like stepping onto a stage. Like singing in front of hundreds of people. Like teaching harmony classes to strangers.

Like falling in love.

Later, alone in my room, I pulled out the lyrics Nick had given me and read them again. Four Seasons. A love that changes with the weather but never fades.

I hummed melody ideas, testing different patterns against the words, imagining how Nick's bass line might weave underneath. We'd write it together, he'd said. His harmony, my melody, creating something new.

Like everything else we built together.

**Three months later**

December came cold and crisp, bringing early darkness and the scent of pine and woodsmoke. The boardwalk was nearly deserted now except for weekends, and even then only the hardiest locals braved the wind off the ocean.

But every Thursday evening, The Melody Box's back room filled with people eager to learn about music. Mr. Gennaro taught music history and theory. Nick and I taught harmony and vocal technique. And slowly, week by week, our students learned to blend their voices, to find their ranges, to create something beautiful together.

Tonight, watching a teenage girl finally nail a harmony she'd been struggling with for weeks, I caught Nick's eye across the room. He smiled that smile that was just for me, and I knew we were both thinking the same thing.

This is what we were meant to do.

After class, after the students left and Mr. Gennaro locked up, Nick and I walked home through the cold December night, our breath forming clouds in the air.

"I got my acceptance letter today," Nick said quietly. "From the music conservatory."

My heart sank even as I tried to smile. "That's wonderful. Spring semester?"

"February. Eight weeks from now." He stopped walking, turning to face me. "I'm going to take it. The program is incredible—everything I need to really develop my skills. But Diane, I need you to know that this doesn't change us. Long distance will be hard, but we'll make it work. Weekend visits, phone calls, letters..."

"I know," I interrupted. "I know we'll make it work. Because what we have—it's worth the effort. It's worth fighting for."

"You really believe that?"

"I really do." I took both his hands, our gloved fingers interlacing. "This summer, you taught me that the real magic isn't in perfect circumstances. It's in choosing each other, every day, through all the seasons. Including the hard ones."

Nick pulled me into a kiss that warmed me despite the December cold.

"I love you," he said. "From now through next summer and all the summers after that."

"I love you too. Always."

We walked the rest of the way in comfortable silence, and when we reached my door, I looked back at the boardwalk—dark and quiet now in winter, so different from the bright summer nights when we'd first met.

But the foundation was still there. The solid pilings beneath the boards. The steady bass line underneath the melody. The love that had started in summer sunshine and grown deeper roots through autumn and winter.

That's what lasted. Not the surface sparkle, but the foundation underneath.

The part that held everything together.

The part that would be there in spring, in summer, through all the seasons to come.

Nick and me. Together. Always.
