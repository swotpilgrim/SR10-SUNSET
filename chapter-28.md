# Chapter 28: Labor Day Sunday

I woke to sunlight streaming through my window and seagulls calling. For a moment I just lay there, smiling, replaying last night. The duet. The pier. Nick's confession. The kisses.

So many kisses.

"Someone's in a good mood," Mama said from my doorway, already dressed for church.

"Better than well." I sat up. "Perfect. It was perfect."

"And Nick?"

"Is picking me up at noon for our first official date." Just saying it made my heart flip. "We're going to spend the day together."

Mama smiled. "Then you'd better get moving. Church first, then you'll have time to get ready."

The morning passed in a blur of Sunday service and small talk with neighbors who'd heard about the duet. Mrs. Patterson squeezed my hand. Mr. Chen mentioned he'd never seen young love quite so obvious. Even Reverend Matthews commented on finding your harmony.

By the time we got home, I had less than an hour.

I changed three times before settling on a simple yellow sundress. Fixed my hair. Added lipstick. Laughed at myself for being nervous.

The doorbell rang at exactly noon.

I raced downstairs. Nick stood on our porch in khaki pants and a button-down, holding daisies.

"Hi," he said, his whole face lighting up.

"Hi yourself."

He handed me the daisies. "I know your family has a flower shop so this is probably silly, but—"

"They're perfect," I interrupted. "Thank you."

Mama appeared with a vase. "I'll put these in water. You two go enjoy your day."

"We'll be back by dinner," Nick said.

"Take your time." Mama shooed us out. "Young love only happens once."

We escaped onto the porch, both grinning. Nick offered his hand and I took it.

"So," I said as we walked down the porch steps. "What's the plan for our first official date?"

"I thought we'd start at the beach. Last good beach day before fall starts." He glanced at me. "Unless you had something else in mind?"

"Beach sounds perfect."

We walked toward the ocean. The boardwalk was quiet compared to last night—most tourists had already left. Vendors offered final-day sales, closing up for the season.

Endings and beginnings tangled together.

The beach stretched out before us, golden sand meeting blue water. A few families had claimed spots near the water. An elderly couple walked hand in hand along the surf.

Nick led me to a quieter section and spread out the blanket he'd brought. We settled close together, facing the ocean.

"This is nice," I said.

"Yeah. I wanted our first real date to be somewhere we could just... be. No crowds, no performance. Just us."

"I like just us."

We sat in comfortable silence, watching the waves, feeling the sun and ocean breeze. So different from last night's intensity—quieter, gentler, but no less meaningful.

"I still can't believe this is real," Nick said eventually.

"It's real." I leaned my head on his shoulder. "I keep thinking the same thing."

"Can I ask you something?"

"Anything."

"When did you know? When did you realize you had feelings for me instead of Peter?"

I considered the question. "I don't think there was one specific moment. It was gradual—every walk home, every conversation, I was falling a little more without realizing it." I paused. "But if I had to choose? That day at The Melody Box when you taught me to hear music differently. You were so passionate, so genuinely yourself. I remember thinking 'this is what I want.' Not the performance. This depth and authenticity."

Nick was quiet. "I knew during the audition. The second our voices blended together, I thought 'this is it.' And then I spent the whole summer watching you look at Peter while trying to convince myself I was okay with just being your friend."

"I'm sorry I put you through that."

"Don't be. You needed to figure it out on your own. If I'd pushed, if I'd confessed earlier, you might have chosen me for the wrong reasons. This way—now—I know it's real. That you chose me because you actually want me, not because I convinced you or because Peter wasn't available."

"I do want you." I turned to look at him. "So much that it kind of scares me sometimes."

"Good scared or bad scared?"

"Good scared. The kind that means it matters."

He kissed me then, soft and sweet, tasting like salt air and promise. When we broke apart, we were both smiling.

"So what happens now?" I asked. "What does being officially together actually mean?"

"Everyone already knows," Nick said, laughing. "After last night? The whole town knows by now."

"Fair point."

"As for what it means..." He took my hand. "It means I get to hold your hand whenever I want. Walk you home every day. Kiss you goodnight. Take you on actual dates. Call you my girlfriend."

"And I get to call you my boyfriend."

"Exactly." He grinned. "Plus we keep making music together. That's non-negotiable."

"Agreed. The music brought us together. It's part of us now."

We spent the next hour talking—about music and dreams and plans. Nick told me about music school in the spring. I admitted his suggestion about voice lessons had been spinning in my head, that maybe I really could pursue music.

"You should," he said firmly. "You have too much talent to waste it. It's about how you connect to the music emotionally. That's a gift."

"You make me braver," I said. "You make me think things are possible I never thought I could do."

"Good. That's what we're supposed to do for each other."

As the afternoon wore on, we walked along the water's edge, shoes off, waves lapping at our feet. Nick told me stories about growing up in Bayshore, learning to sing in his church choir. I told him about my father, the flower shop, feeling stuck between who I was and who I thought I should be.

"Sally's pretty smart," Nick observed.

"Don't tell her that. She'll be insufferable."

"Too late. I'm pretty sure she already knows."

We ended up back on our blanket as the sun started its descent. The beach had emptied—families packing up, the end-of-summer exodus in full swing.

"This time tomorrow, everyone will be gone," I said. "Summer will officially be over."

"But we'll still be here." Nick pulled me closer. "That's what matters. The tourists leave, the season ends, but we don't end with it."

"Promise?"

"I promise. Diane Foster, I'm not going anywhere. We'll figure out long distance when the time comes. You're not getting rid of me that easily."

"Good. Because I have no intention of letting you go."

We watched the sunset together, the sky turning brilliant shades of pink and orange and purple. The same sunset that had provided the backdrop for so many summer nights. But tonight it felt different. Like it was ours.

When the sun dipped below the horizon, Nick stood and offered me his hand.

"Come on. One more stop before I take you home."

He led me back through the quiet boardwalk to The Melody Box. Mr. Gennaro was just locking up, but his weathered face brightened when he saw us approaching.

"Nick! Diane! Perfect timing." He unlocked the door again with a knowing smile. "Come in, come in. I have something special for you both."

We followed him inside. The shop was dim, most of the lights already off, but Mr. Gennaro led us to the back room where he pulled out a worn record sleeve with careful reverence.

"This," he said, "is a recording of Ella Fitzgerald and Louis Armstrong singing together. Two very different voices—soprano and bass/baritone. But when they harmonize..." He kissed his fingers in that Italian gesture of perfection. "Magic. Pure magic. Like you two last night."

He handed the record to Nick. "A gift. For two young people just beginning their musical journey together."

"Mr. Gennaro, you've already given us so much," I protested.

"Music is meant to be shared. And you two—you remind me why I fell in love with music in the first place. The way you sing together, the way you found each other through harmony... that's the beauty of it all."

We thanked him profusely, promised to visit often, and finally headed back into the evening air. Nick walked me home slowly, taking the long route, neither of us ready for the day to end.

At my door, he pulled me close.

"Best first date ever," he said.

"Agreed. Though I might be biased since you're my first real boyfriend."

"And hopefully your last."

"Hopefully?" I raised an eyebrow.

"Definitely. Definitely your last." He kissed me to emphasize the point.

When we finally said goodnight, I floated inside on a cloud of happiness. Mama took one look at my face and smiled.

"Good day?"

"Perfect day. Absolutely perfect."

And it had been. No drama, no performance, no grand gestures. Just Nick and me, being together, being real, being us.

Exactly as it should be.
