# Chapter 4: The Competition Announcement

Friday evening brought perfect beach weather and the biggest crowd I'd seen all week. The bandstand area was packed, everyone dressed in their best casual clothes.

I'd arrived twenty minutes early to claim my usual spot, squeezed in tighter than normal. The redhead with the green scarf stood to my left, giggling girls to my right. Barbara Wellington commanded her position at the front, wearing a pink dress that matched the sunset.

The energy felt different tonight—anticipatory, electric. I wasn't sure why until Sally appeared at my elbow, slightly out of breath.

"I've been looking everywhere for you," she panted. "Did you hear?"

"Hear what?"

"The Bayside Boys are making some kind of special announcement tonight. Everyone at the arcade was talking about it." Her eyes sparkled with excitement. "Debbie Morrison—Tommy's sister—said it's something big."

My stomach fluttered with nervous energy. "What kind of announcement?"

"That's all I know. But look at this crowd." Sally gestured at the packed boardwalk. "Word definitely got around."

The Bayside Boys appeared right on time, and the crowd's reaction was louder than usual—applause and whistles and a few enthusiastic shouts. Peter grinned at the reception, clearly enjoying it. He stepped to the microphone and held up his hands for quiet.

"Wow, what a turnout! You folks are the best audience in New Jersey." He paused for the appreciative response, his timing perfect. "Now, before we start tonight's show, we've got something special to share with you."

The crowd pressed forward slightly, everyone straining to hear. I found myself holding my breath.

"As most of you know, Labor Day weekend is coming up fast." Peter's voice took on a showman's cadence. "And we want to end this summer season with something really special. So we're hosting a singing competition!"

The crowd erupted in excited chatter. Sally grabbed my arm, her fingers digging in.

Peter waited for the noise to die down before continuing. "Here's how it works: Any girl can sign up for auditions next Thursday evening, right here. You'll sing one song with the group—we'll help you out. And the winner..." He paused for effect. "Gets to perform a featured duet with the Bayside Boys at our special end-of-summer show Labor Day weekend."

The reaction was immediate. Girls around me started talking all at once.

"Oh my gosh, can you imagine?"

"I'm definitely signing up!"

Sally turned to me, her face alight. "Diane, you have to do this."

"What?" I stared at her. "No. Absolutely not."

"Why not? You have a beautiful voice!"

"I sing in the shower and when I'm alone in the shop. That's completely different from performing in front of—" I gestured at the massive crowd. "—everyone."

"But this is your chance!" Sally insisted. "You've been mooning over Peter Castellano all summer. This is how you get him to actually notice you."

My heart was racing at the very thought. Performing with Peter. Singing beside him, his attention finally focused on me instead of the anonymous crowd. It was everything I'd been dreaming about.

It was also absolutely terrifying.

"I can't," I whispered.

Peter continued. "Sign-up sheet will be right here after tonight's show. Auditions next Thursday at seven. And don't be shy, ladies—we want to hear what you've got!"

He launched into the first song, and the performance began. But I couldn't focus. My mind was spinning with possibility and panic.

What if I actually did it? What if I signed up?

I could sing—I knew I could. Mama always said I had a lovely voice, and even Sally had complimented me. But that was different from standing on a stage in front of hundreds of people, trying to harmonize with a professional group.

What if I froze? What if my voice cracked? What if I forgot the words?

But what if I didn't try?

The thought stopped my spiraling panic. What if I didn't try, and some other girl won? What if I spent the rest of the summer—the rest of my life—wondering what might have happened if I'd just been brave enough to step forward?

I watched Peter perform, his confidence effortless and natural. He made it look so easy, like being the center of attention was as natural as breathing. I could never be like that.

But maybe I didn't have to be. Maybe I just had to be brave for one song.

"Think about it," Sally murmured beside me. "You've been coming to these shows every single night. You know all the words, you understand the harmonies. You could do this, Di."

The performance continued—three songs that blurred together in my distracted state. When the final notes faded and Peter thanked the crowd, the surge toward the bandstand was immediate.

Girls pushed forward, all heading for the same destination. I caught glimpses of familiar faces in the crowd—Barbara Wellington, looking supremely confident; the redhead with the green scarf, clutching her friend's hand; two girls from my high school whose names I couldn't remember.

"Come on," Sally said, tugging my arm. "Let's at least go look at the sign-up sheet."

I let her pull me forward, my feet moving on autopilot. The crowd was thick around the bandstand, everyone trying to get close to the table where Joey had set up a clipboard with several sheets of paper attached.

Peter stood nearby, chatting with eager participants, while Tommy and Nick began packing up the evening's equipment. I caught a glimpse of Nick coiling cables with his usual methodical precision, his face turned away from the commotion.

"Look, there's still room," Sally said, pointing at the sign-up sheet. Already a dozen names filled the first page, written in various styles of looping handwriting.

My hands started shaking. This was real. This was actually happening.

Barbara Wellington stepped up to the clipboard, signed her name with a flourish, then turned and nearly bumped into me. She looked me up and down with barely concealed dismissal.

"Are you signing up?" Her tone suggested the very idea was ridiculous.

Pride flared hot in my chest. "Maybe."

"Hmm." Barbara's smile didn't reach her eyes. "Well, good luck. You'll need it."

She walked away, her pink skirt swishing, and I felt my resolve harden. I didn't even particularly like performing. But I wasn't about to let Barbara Wellington make me feel small.

"Do it," Sally whispered. "Do it right now before you lose your nerve."

I stepped forward before I could think better of it. The clipboard was right there, the pen attached by a string. My hand reached out, trembling slightly.

What was I doing? This was insane. I couldn't perform in front of hundreds of people. I'd spent all summer being invisible, safe in my anonymous spot in the crowd. This was the opposite of safe.

But maybe that was the point. Maybe I was tired of being invisible.

I picked up the pen.

My handwriting looked small and uncertain next to Barbara's confident scrawl, but I wrote it anyway: Diane Foster.

There. Done. No taking it back now.

I set down the pen and stepped away quickly, my heart hammering so hard I could feel it in my throat. Sally appeared beside me, beaming.

"You did it! Oh, Diane, I'm so proud of you!"

"I think I'm going to be sick," I muttered.

"You're going to be amazing. Peter won't know what hit him."

We moved away from the crowd, walking slowly back toward the quieter end of the boardwalk. My legs felt shaky, and my mind was already spinning with second thoughts.

What had I done? What had I been thinking?

"Stop it," Sally said, reading my expression. "You made the right choice. This is your chance to actually live your summer instead of just watching it happen to other people."

Her words echoed my own thoughts from nights before. Watching life happen wasn't the same as living it.

"I don't know what to sing," I said, the practical concern suddenly overwhelming. "I don't know what song to choose or how to prepare or—"

"You have a week to figure it out. And you know all their songs already. Just pick your favorite."

We reached Foster's Flowers, and I stopped on the sidewalk outside, looking back toward the bandstand. From this distance, I could still see the cluster of people around the sign-up sheet, still hear the excited chatter carrying on the evening breeze.

"What if I freeze up there?" I asked quietly. "What if I can't do it?"

"Then at least you tried," Sally said. "That's already braver than most people ever are."

She hugged me quickly and headed back toward the arcade, leaving me standing alone on the sidewalk. Above the shop, lights glowed in our apartment windows. Mama would be waiting, probably wondering where I was.

I climbed the stairs slowly, my mind still reeling.

"There you are," Mama said when I came through the door. "I was starting to worry. How was the performance?"

"They announced a singing competition," I heard myself say. "For a chance to perform with the Bayside Boys at their end-of-summer show."

Mama set down her book, her attention sharpening. "Oh? That sounds exciting."

"I signed up for auditions."

The words hung in the air between us. Mama's expression shifted through surprise, concern, and finally settled on something that looked like pride.

"Did you?" she said softly. "That took courage."

"Or stupidity. I haven't decided which yet."

She stood and crossed to where I stood by the door, still frozen with indecision. Her hands were warm on my shoulders.

"Your father used to say that the things we don't try are what we regret most," she said. "Not the things we try and fail at, but the chances we were too afraid to take."

My throat tightened. "What if I fail in front of everyone?"

"Then you'll survive it," Mama said simply. "And you'll know you were brave enough to try. That's worth more than you think."

I nodded, not trusting my voice.

That night, I lay in bed staring at the ceiling, replaying the evening over and over. The announcement. The surge of the crowd. Barbara's dismissive look. The moment my hand had signed my name on that clipboard.

And underneath it all, a little thrill of possibility.

I was going to audition. I was going to stand on that stage next to Peter Castellano and sing.

The thought terrified me and thrilled me in equal measure.

Outside my window, the distant sound of waves provided a steady rhythm, and somewhere far down the boardwalk, music drifted from one of the late-night venues. I closed my eyes and imagined standing in the spotlight, Peter's attention finally focused on me.

Maybe I could do this. Maybe I could be brave.

I had one week to find out.
