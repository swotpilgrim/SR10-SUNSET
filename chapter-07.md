# Chapter 7: Nick Steps Forward

I woke up the next morning to sunlight streaming through my window and the immediate memory of last night's humiliation crashing over me like a wave.

I'd frozen on stage. In front of everyone. In front of Peter.

I pulled my pillow over my face and groaned.

"Diane?" Mama's voice came through the door, followed by a gentle knock. "Sally's here to see you."

"Tell her I died of embarrassment," I called back.

"She said she expected you'd say that, and she's not leaving until you talk to her."

I dragged myself out of bed, still wearing yesterday's blue dress because I'd been too exhausted to change last night. My reflection in the mirror showed smudged mascara and tangled hair. Perfect. I looked exactly how I felt.

Sally was sitting at our kitchen table with a cup of coffee and a grin that made me immediately suspicious.

"What?" I asked warily.

"You won."

The words didn't make sense. I stared at her blankly. "What?"

"The competition. You won. You and Nick are performing the duet at the end-of-summer show."

"That's not funny, Sally."

"I'm not joking!" She pulled a folded piece of paper from her pocket—one of the Bayside Boys' promotional flyers. "Look. They announced it last night after all the auditions. You and Nick had 'unexpected chemistry' and 'unique vocal blend.' Peter's words, not mine."

I took the flyer with numb fingers. Sure enough, scrawled across the bottom in Peter's handwriting: "Winner: Diane Foster & Nick Romano - Saturday Labor Day Weekend."

"But I didn't win," I whispered. "I barely sang. Nick had to save me."

"Exactly. And when he did, it created something special. The way your voices worked together—" Sally's expression turned serious. "Di, it was beautiful. Different from anything else we heard that night. Peter recognized it. Everyone did."

I sank into the chair across from her, my mind spinning. "I'm going to perform with Nick."

"Yep."

"Not Peter. Nick."

"Yep."

"But I wanted..." I trailed off, realizing how shallow it sounded. I'd wanted Peter's attention. I'd wanted to stand beside the lead singer in the spotlight. I'd wanted the fantasy I'd been nursing all summer.

"I know what you wanted," Sally said gently. "But maybe you got something better."

I couldn't process it. Everything felt upside down and backwards.

"When do I..." I swallowed hard. "When do we rehearse?"

"Peter said they'll contact you to set up practice times. Probably start next week since you've got a month until the show."

A month. I had a month to prepare to stand on stage again, to face that crowd, to somehow not freeze up the way I had last night.

The thought made my stomach churn with fresh anxiety.

"I can't do this," I said. "Sally, I can't. Last night proved I'm not cut out for performing. I should tell them I'm withdrawing."

"Don't you dare." Sally's voice turned fierce. "You earned this, Di. You were brave enough to try, and it paid off. Don't throw that away because you're scared."

"I'm terrified."

"Good. That means it matters." She reached across the table and grabbed my hand. "Besides, you won't be alone up there. You'll have Nick. And he already proved he's got your back."

That part was true. When I'd been drowning, Nick had thrown me a lifeline without hesitation.

"I don't even know him," I said quietly. "We've never had a real conversation."

"So get to know him. You're going to be spending a lot of time together anyway." Sally finished her coffee and stood. "I have to get to work, but promise me you won't back out. Promise."

"I don't—"

"Promise, Diane."

I sighed. "Fine. I promise."

"Good. Now go shower and change. You look like you lost a fight with your pillow."

After Sally left, I stood under hot water for a long time, trying to wrap my head around this new reality. I'd won. Sort of. With Nick's help, I'd actually won the competition.

But it didn't feel like victory. It felt like I'd been given a second chance to fail publicly, and this time it would be even worse because there would be a whole month of anticipation building up to it.

I spent the day at Foster's Flowers in a daze, arranging bouquets on autopilot while my mind churned with anxiety. Customers congratulated me—apparently word had already spread through Bayshore's small community about the competition results. Each time I had to smile and accept their enthusiasm while internally panicking.

That evening, I went to the boardwalk for the Bayside Boys' performance. I told myself I was just maintaining my routine, but really I needed to see Nick. To understand how he felt about this unexpected pairing.

The crowd was smaller than usual—Friday night's auditions had satisfied people's curiosity, and we were back to the regular attendees. I took my usual spot and waited.

When the Bayside Boys took the stage, my eyes went straight to Nick at the back. He looked the same as always—serious expression, methodical in his movements, providing the foundation while Peter shone in the spotlight.

Did he resent having to perform with me? Was he annoyed that my failure had trapped him into this partnership?

The performance started, and I tried to focus on the music. But I kept watching Nick, searching for clues about what he was thinking. His face revealed nothing.

After the third song ended and Peter thanked the crowd, I lingered while most people dispersed. The Bayside Boys began their usual pack-up routine. I should approach them. Should talk to Nick. But my feet felt rooted to the boardwalk.

"You look like you're trying to solve a complicated math problem," a voice said beside me.

I jumped and turned to find Nick standing there, cable coiled in his hands. Up close, he was taller than I'd realized, with kind eyes that watched me patiently.

"I was just..." I scrambled for words. "I wanted to... thank you. For last night. For helping me."

"You already thanked me."

"Well, thank you again." I twisted my hands together nervously. "And I'm sorry you got stuck partnered with me for the show. I know you were just being kind, and now you're trapped performing with someone who can barely sing in front of people without freezing up."

Nick tilted his head slightly, studying me. "You think I got trapped?"

"Didn't you?"

"Diane, I stepped forward because I wanted to. Not because I felt obligated." He shifted the cable to one hand. "And the only reason we won is because what we created together was worth listening to. Peter wouldn't have chosen us otherwise."

The sincerity in his voice made something in my chest loosen slightly.

"I still froze," I said quietly. "I couldn't even start singing."

"You were scared. That's normal. But once you found your footing, your voice was beautiful." He said it so matter-of-factly, like it was an obvious truth rather than a compliment.

I felt heat creep into my cheeks. "I don't know if I can do it again. The big show, I mean. All those people..."

"You won't be alone up there. We'll practice, you'll get comfortable with the material, and I'll be right beside you the whole time." Nick's steady gaze held mine. "You don't have to carry it by yourself."

Something about the way he said it made me believe him. Not that it would be easy, but that it would be possible.

"When do we start rehearsing?" I asked.

"How about tomorrow afternoon? There's a record shop where I work—The Melody Box. It has a back room we can use for practice. Quieter than trying to rehearse on the boardwalk."

"Okay." I nodded, my anxiety still present but no longer quite so overwhelming. "Tomorrow afternoon."

"Two o'clock?"

"I'll be there."

Nick smiled then—a real smile, not Peter's practiced charm but something genuine and warm. "Good. I'll see you tomorrow, Diane."

He walked back to rejoin the others, leaving me standing alone but somehow feeling less adrift than I had all day.

I walked home slowly, replaying the conversation. Nick's quiet confidence, his reassurance that I wouldn't be alone. The way he'd said my name like it mattered.

"How did it go?" Mama asked when I came upstairs.

"I'm meeting Nick tomorrow to practice. At the record shop where he works."

She looked up from her mending, eyebrows raised. "Nick, is it? Not Peter?"

"Peter's the lead singer. But Nick's my duet partner." The words felt strange to say out loud. "He's the one who helped me last night."

"The bass singer." Mama's expression softened. "The one who stepped forward when you needed help."

"Yes."

"I'd like to meet him sometime."

"You will," I said. "Probably a lot, actually, if we're going to be rehearsing for a month."

That night, lying in bed, I thought about the difference between fantasies and reality. I'd spent all summer dreaming about Peter—about his attention, his smile, the imaginary romance I'd built in my head.

But when I'd actually needed someone, when I'd been at my most vulnerable, it had been Nick who'd stepped forward.

Nick, who'd created space for me to find my voice when I couldn't find it on my own.

Nick, who looked at me with those steady eyes and made me feel like maybe, just maybe, I could actually do this impossible thing.

I pulled out my box of performance flyers and looked at the photograph of the Bayside Boys. For the first time, my eyes didn't automatically go to Peter's smile. Instead, I found Nick standing at the back, serious and solid.

The foundation.

The one holding everything together.

The one I should have been looking at all along.

I tucked the flyer away and closed my eyes, and for the first time all summer, Peter Castellano wasn't the face I saw in my dreams.
