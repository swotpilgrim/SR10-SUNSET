# Chapter 13: The Songwriter Revealed

I'd been walking past The Melody Box every day for years without really seeing it. Now, knowing it was where Nick worked, where we practiced, where he'd kissed me for the first time, the shop felt like sacred ground.

Monday afternoon found me there again, though we didn't have rehearsal scheduled. I told myself I was just browsing records, but really I wanted to see Nick.

He was behind the counter when I entered, helping an older woman find a Glenn Miller album. When he saw me, his whole face lit up.

"Be right with you," he mouthed.

I browsed the jazz section while he finished with his customer, running my fingers over album spines, not really reading the names. I was too aware of Nick across the room, too conscious of the fact that we were something now. Something real and defined.

"Fancy meeting you here," Nick said, appearing beside me once the customer left.

"I was in the neighborhood."

"You were not. The flower shop's in the other direction."

I smiled, caught. "Fine. I wanted to see you. Is that allowed?"

"Highly encouraged, actually." He glanced toward the front of the shop. "Mr. Gennaro's on his lunch break. We've got the place to ourselves for twenty minutes."

He led me to the back room, and as soon as we were through the door, he kissed me. Different from Saturday's careful first kiss—this one was confident, claiming, like he'd been thinking about it all weekend.

"Hi," he said when we finally pulled apart.

"Hi yourself."

We settled into our usual chairs, and Nick pulled out a notebook I'd never seen before. "I want to show you something. But you have to promise not to laugh."

"I promise."

He opened the notebook to reveal pages of musical notation interspersed with lyrics. Songs—dozens of them, in various stages of completion.

"You write all of these?" I asked, amazed.

"Yeah. Most of them are garbage, but a few..." He flipped to a page near the middle. "This one's the song we're performing. The one I wrote for us."

I studied the notation, seeing corrections and crossed-out sections, evidence of the work that went into making something look effortless.

"And these others?"

"Some are for the Bayside Boys. Peter takes the ones he likes and we arrange them for the group." Nick's expression turned wry. "He takes credit for them too, but that's fine. They're just songs."

"They're not just songs. They're your art." I flipped through more pages, seeing the evidence of his creativity. "Does he know you write all of these?"

"Peter? Sure. But he's the front man, the name people know. Having him present them as 'ours' makes sense from a marketing standpoint."

"That doesn't make it right."

Nick shrugged. "I learned a long time ago that being the foundation means not getting the glory. I'm okay with it."

But he wasn't, not really. I could hear the resignation in his voice, see it in the way he held himself. He'd accepted invisibility as his role, but that didn't mean it didn't hurt.

"Will you play something for me?" I asked. "One of the ones Peter hasn't taken yet?"

He hesitated, then flipped to a page near the back. "This one's new. I've been working on it the past few weeks."

He set the notebook between us and started to hum the melody, tapping out the rhythm on his knee. It was beautiful—more complex than the song he'd written for our duet, with layered harmonies and tempo shifts that told a story all on their own.

"That's incredible," I breathed when he finished. "Nick, that's really incredible."

"You think so?"

"I know so. You have real talent. This isn't just hobby music—this is professional level."

He ducked his head, embarrassed by the praise but clearly pleased. "That's the dream. Writing music that matters. Maybe composing for orchestras or arranging for bigger groups. But that's college stuff. Professional stuff. For now, I'm just the bass singer in a boardwalk doo-wop group."

"You're so much more than that."

"To you, maybe."

"To anyone who's actually paying attention." I reached for his hand. "Nick, why do you let Peter take credit? You could ask for recognition. Could demand it."

"Because Peter's my best friend. We've known each other since we were kids. And he needs the attention in a way I don't. His whole identity is wrapped up in being the lead singer, the front man. Taking that away from him..." Nick shook his head. "I can't do that to him."

"Even if it means staying invisible?"

"I'm not invisible to the people who matter." He squeezed my hand. "Mr. Gennaro knows I write. My family knows. And now you know. That's enough."

I wanted to argue that it wasn't enough, that he deserved more. But I understood loyalty, understood the complicated dynamics of long friendship. And maybe Nick was right—maybe being seen by the people who mattered was more valuable than public recognition.

"Will you show me more?" I asked, gesturing to the notebook. "I want to know all of them. Every song you've ever written."

His smile was soft and grateful. "All of them? That'll take a while."

"I've got time."

We spent the next hour going through his notebook, Nick explaining the inspiration behind each song, the technical choices he'd made, the ones that worked and the ones that didn't. I listened in amazement, realizing the depth of talent he'd been hiding all summer.

This was the real Nick Romano. Not the quiet bass singer in the background, but a creative force, a genuine artist with vision and skill and passion.

And he was sharing it all with me.

"That's Mr. Gennaro," Nick said when the front bell chimed. He reluctantly closed the notebook. "I should get back out front."

"Thank you for showing me." I touched the notebook cover. "For trusting me with this."

"You're the first person I've wanted to share them with. Besides Peter, I mean, but that's different. He takes what he wants and doesn't really listen to the rest." Nick stood, pulling me up with him. "You actually care about the craft, not just the end product."

"Because it's you," I said simply. "Everything about you matters to me."

He kissed me again, sweet and lingering, then walked me out to the front of the shop. Mr. Gennaro was back from lunch, sorting through a new shipment of records.

"Afternoon, Miss Foster," he said with a knowing twinkle in his eye. "Finding everything you need?"

"Yes, sir. Nick's been very helpful."

"I bet he has."

I left The Melody Box with my head full of melodies and my heart full of understanding. I'd spent all summer watching Peter Castellano perform songs that Nick had written, crediting Peter's talent when it was really Nick's craft.

How many other people made the same mistake? How many times had Nick stood in the background while someone else got praised for his work?

That evening at the performance, I watched with new eyes. The romantic ballad they opened with—I recognized the structure now, the careful harmonies, the technical excellence that went into making it look effortless. This was Nick's composition. Nick's arrangement. Nick's art.

But when the audience applauded, they screamed for Peter.

After the show, during our walk home, I brought it up.

"The opening song tonight. That was one from your notebook, wasn't it?"

"Yeah. One of the early ones. Peter liked it, so we added it to the regular set."

"Do people know you wrote it?"

"Peter knows. The other guys know. That's enough."

"Is it really? Or is that what you tell yourself so it hurts less?"

Nick was quiet for a long moment. "You don't pull punches, do you?"

"I care about you. I don't want to watch you diminish yourself."

"I'm not diminishing myself. I'm choosing my battles. There's a difference."

"Okay." I let it drop, sensing I was pushing too hard. "But for the record, I think you're brilliant. And I think more people should know it."

"Noted." He pulled me closer, wrapping his arm around my shoulders. "You're not going to let this go, are you?"

"Probably not."

"Good. I need someone in my corner. Someone who sees past the humble bass singer routine."

"I'm always in your corner," I promised. "Even when you're being stubbornly modest about your talent."

He laughed, pressing a kiss to my temple. "What did I do to deserve you?"

"You stepped forward when I was frozen. You taught me to hear music differently. You wrote me a song." I looked up at him. "You saw me. That's what you did."

We walked the rest of the way in comfortable silence, and when we reached my building, Nick pulled me into our usual alcove for a goodnight kiss that left me breathless.

"Sunday dinner," he reminded me. "You, me, and the whole chaotic Romano clan."

"I'm terrified."

"Don't be. They're going to love you." He kissed me once more. "Almost as much as I do."

The words hung in the air between us, shocking and perfect and terrifying all at once.

"Nick—"

"You don't have to say it back. I just needed you to know." He smiled, soft and sure. "Goodnight, Diane."

"Goodnight."

I climbed the stairs in a daze. He loved me. Nick Romano loved me.

And the terrifying, wonderful truth was that I loved him back.

I just had to figure out how to be brave enough to say it.
