# Chapter 10: Unexpected Ease

By the end of my second week walking home with Nick after performances, I realized I'd stopped thinking of them as walks and started thinking of them as the best part of my day.

"Tell me something you've never told anyone," Nick said one evening as we strolled past the arcade.

The request was sudden and unexpected, catching me mid-thought about a customer's difficult rose order.

"That's a big ask," I said.

"You don't have to. I'm just curious about the things you keep to yourself."

I thought about it, turning over secrets and half-formed dreams in my mind. "I don't think I want to run the flower shop forever," I said finally. "Everyone assumes I'll take over from Mama eventually, and I love the work, but... I don't think it's my whole future. Does that make me ungrateful?"

"Not even a little bit." Nick's voice was gentle. "What would you do instead?"

"I don't know yet. That's the scary part—being certain about what I don't want before I know what I do want."

"That's called being seventeen. I think it's normal."

We walked in silence for a moment before I turned the question back on him. "Your turn. Tell me something you've never told anyone."

He took his time answering, his expression thoughtful. "Sometimes I resent Peter. Not all the time, and not in a way that affects our friendship. But sometimes I watch him take credit for arrangements I wrote, or see girls throw themselves at him while I'm invisible in the background, and I feel... small. Petty." He glanced at me. "That probably makes me sound terrible."

"It makes you sound human."

"Peter's my best friend. We grew up together. I love the guy. But being in his shadow all the time..." Nick shook his head. "I chose this role. I'm good at being foundation. But sometimes I wonder what it would feel like to be seen."

My chest tightened with understanding. "You step back on purpose? It's not just where you ended up?"

"Yeah. Bass singers are supposed to be background. We're taught to blend, to support, to disappear into the structure. And I'm good at it—really good. But good at disappearing starts to feel a lot like being invisible."

I thought about all the evenings I'd stood in the crowd watching Peter, barely registering Nick's presence. How many other people did the same thing? How many times had Nick provided the foundation for something beautiful while everyone praised the surface shine?

"I see you now," I said quietly.

"I know." He smiled. "That's new."

Over the next several evenings, our conversations deepened. Nick told me about his large Italian family—how being the middle of five kids taught him to observe rather than demand attention, how family dinners were loud and chaotic but full of love. I told him about the quiet that had settled over our apartment after my father died, how Mama and I had learned to communicate in small gestures rather than big conversations.

"Do you miss him?" Nick asked one night. "Your father?"

"Every day. But differently now than I used to." We'd stopped at the railing to look out at the ocean, dark and endless under the stars. "Right after he died, missing him was this huge, crushing thing. Now it's gentler. More like... he's part of the background music of my life. Always there but not overwhelming everything else."

"Background music," Nick repeated. "I like that."

During the day, I found myself thinking about our evening walks more than was probably healthy. Customers would ask questions at the shop, and I'd answer on autopilot while mentally replaying something Nick had said, or planning what I'd ask him next.

Sally noticed, of course.

"You're humming," she said one afternoon, catching me arranging a centerpiece while unconsciously singing one of the Bayside Boys' songs.

"I always hum while I work."

"Not like that. You're happy-humming. Like someone with a secret."

I tried to keep my expression neutral. "I don't have a secret."

"Uh-huh. How are rehearsals going with Nick?"

"Good. We practice every Saturday at The Melody Box. He's a really patient teacher."

"And the walks home? How are those going?"

Heat crept into my cheeks. "They're nice. We talk."

"About what?"

"Everything. Music and family and dreams and..." I set down my scissors. "He listens, Sally. Actually listens, like what I'm saying matters."

"And how do you feel about Peter these days?"

The question caught me off guard. I realized I hadn't thought about Peter—really thought about him, with that old flutter of attraction—in over a week.

"Peter's... Peter," I said vaguely.

Sally's grin was knowing. "Oh, honey. You've got it bad."

"Got what bad?"

"A crush on Nick Romano instead of Peter Castellano. Which is probably the smartest thing you've done all summer."

"I don't have a crush on Nick," I protested, but even as I said it, I knew it wasn't entirely true. My feelings were too complicated to call a crush—more like fascination mixed with genuine friendship mixed with something I wasn't ready to name yet.

That evening at the performance, I watched both Peter and Nick with new awareness. Peter performed with his usual charisma, working the crowd like he'd been born to it. And he was good—really good. His voice was beautiful, his stage presence magnetic.

But when I listened to Nick's bass line underneath, I heard the real heart of the music. The structure that made Peter's shine possible. The foundation that held everything together.

After the show, Nick appeared at my side as usual.

"Walk you home?"

"Please."

We'd developed a routine over the past two weeks. First we'd walk in silence for a few minutes, letting the performance energy settle. Then one of us would start talking, and conversation would flow until we reached Foster's Flowers.

Tonight, Nick was quieter than usual.

"Everything okay?" I asked.

"Just thinking."

"About?"

He was quiet for so long I thought he wouldn't answer. Finally: "About how much I'm going to miss this when summer ends."

The words hit me harder than I expected. Of course summer would end. Labor Day was only a few weeks away. After the big performance, tourists would leave, the Bayside Boys would probably disband until next year, and everything would return to normal.

Normal. The word felt wrong now, like trying on clothes that no longer fit.

"What happens after Labor Day?" I asked. "Do you leave for college right away?"

"Not until spring semester. I'm taking the fall to work and save money. But the group will stop performing regularly." He glanced at me. "These walks will end."

The thought created an unexpected ache in my chest. These walks had become essential to my days, the anchor point everything else revolved around.

"We could still walk," I said. "Even without the performances."

"Yeah?"

"Yeah. I mean, if you want to."

"I want to." His voice was quiet but certain.

We'd reached my building, but instead of saying goodnight immediately, we lingered on the sidewalk. This had become part of the routine too—these extra few minutes where neither of us wanted to be the first to leave.

"Diane?" Nick's voice was tentative. "Can I ask you something?"

"Of course."

"Why did you really sign up for the competition?" When I started to give my usual answer, he stopped me. "I know what you've said—about stepping forward, being part of things. But there was more to it, wasn't there?"

I could lie. Deflect. Keep the shallow truth about Peter hidden.

But Nick deserved honesty.

"I wanted Peter to notice me," I admitted. "I'd been watching him all summer, and I thought if I could perform with the group, if I could win the competition, he'd finally see me. It was stupid and shallow, and I'm embarrassed about it now."

Nick was quiet, processing this.

"I'm sorry," I continued. "I know that's probably not what you wanted to hear. And it's not how I feel anymore, but it's the truth about why I originally signed up."

"No, I..." Nick ran a hand through his hair. "I knew. I mean, I suspected. Everyone watches Peter. I'm used to it."

"I was an idiot."

"You were seeing what everyone sees—the obvious choice. The surface." He looked at me directly. "But you're not seeing that anymore, are you?"

My heart was beating too fast. "No. I'm not."

The moment stretched between us, weighted with something unnamed. Upstairs, Mama's silhouette moved past the window, and the spell broke.

"I should go in," I said. "Goodnight, Nick."

"Goodnight, Diane."

I climbed the stairs feeling like something had shifted, like we'd crossed an invisible line in that conversation. When I looked back, Nick was still standing on the sidewalk, looking up at the windows.

When our eyes met, he raised his hand in a small wave before turning and walking away.

"You're late," Mama said when I came inside.

"We were talking."

"Must have been quite a conversation. Your face is all flushed."

I touched my cheeks, feeling the warmth there. "It was... it was good. Honest."

"Honesty's important," Mama said carefully. "Especially when feelings are involved."

I wanted to deny that feelings were involved, but the words stuck in my throat. Because feelings were involved—complicated, confusing feelings that I was only beginning to understand.

That night, I lay in bed thinking about walking home with Nick, about his quiet question and my honest answer, about the way he'd looked at me when I admitted I wasn't watching Peter anymore.

Something was growing between us. Something built on conversation and music and genuine connection. Something real.

And for the first time all summer, instead of dreaming about fantasies and impossible crushes, I let myself imagine something that might actually be possible.

If I was brave enough to reach for it.
