# Chapter 23: The Final Performance Night

Saturday evening arrived with perfect beach weather—warm, a gentle breeze carrying the scent of salt and suntan oil, the western sky already streaked with pink and gold.

The end of summer. And potentially, the beginning of something new.

I stood at my bedroom window watching the boardwalk come alive below. Crowds gathered thicker than any previous performance, locals and tourists converging for the Bayside Boys' final show of 1957.

"You're going to wear a path in that floor," Mama said from my doorway.

I turned from the window, my hands twisting together nervously. "What if I freeze again? What if I get up there and can't sing?"

"Then Nick will be right beside you, just like he was at the audition." She crossed the room and took my hands. "You're not the same girl who auditioned weeks ago. You know the music. You trust Nick. And you trust yourself now."

"I trust us together," I said.

"That's what trust really means—knowing you don't have to do everything alone." She smiled. "You look beautiful, by the way."

I glanced down at the blue dress—the same one from auditions, carefully pressed all summer. Nick had noticed it when I wore it to practice, his eyes softening with recognition.

"It's my lucky dress."

"Then it's perfect. Are you ready?"

"I'm terrified. But I'm going anyway."

"That's real bravery, honey."

I grabbed my cardigan and headed downstairs, my stomach a tangle of nerves and anticipation. Mama followed, locking up the shop behind us as we stepped onto the boardwalk.

Every few feet, someone called out greetings. Mrs. Patterson squeezed my arm. Mr. Gennaro gave me a thumbs up.

"The whole town's turned out," I murmured to Mama.

"End-of-summer tradition. Plus everyone's curious about the famous duet."

We reached the bandstand to find it completely packed. Every folding chair occupied, people standing three and four deep, families on blankets claiming every available spot. The sun hung low over the ocean, gilding everything in late-afternoon light.

"There's Sally," Mama said. "I'm going to find a spot to watch."

She kissed my cheek and disappeared. I made my way to Sally, who stood with Tommy Morrison. She squealed and pulled me into a hug.

"Tonight's the night! Are you excited? Nervous? Both?"

"Definitely both." I glanced at Tommy. "How's Nick doing?"

"Pretending to be calm, actually vibrating with nerves. He was asking if you'd arrived yet. You should probably go find him before we start."

"Yeah, but Nick's been pacing back there for an hour. Put him out of his misery."

I made my way backstage where the boys stored equipment. My heart pounded—not from stage fright but from anticipation of seeing him before this huge moment.

Nick stood adjusting his collar in a small mirror, shoulders tight, hands fidgeting. His anxiety showed in every movement.

"Hey," I said softly.

He spun around, his whole face transforming when he saw me. The tension melted from his shoulders.

"You're here."

"Where else would I be?"

He crossed to me, taking my hands. "You look beautiful. That's the dress from—"

"From the audition. When you saved me." I squeezed his hands. "Seemed appropriate."

"Are you scared?"

"Terrified. You?"

"Same." He pulled me closer, resting his forehead against mine. "But I'm so glad we're doing this together."

"Nick Romano, are you admitting to being nervous about performing?"

"I'm terrified of performing in the spotlight. Always have been. The only reason I can do this tonight is because you'll be right there with me." His thumb traced circles on my hand. "We hold each other up."

The sound of the crowd swelling filtered back to us. Peter's voice carried through, warming up the audience with his characteristic charm.

"That's our cue," Nick said. "Regular set first, then us."

"Then us," I echoed, and the words felt weighted with more than just performance.

We emerged from backstage together. Peter saw us and waved, a genuine smile on his face. Whatever had been between us had resolved into friendly indifference.

"Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, welcome to the Bayside Boys' final performance of summer 1957!" Peter's voice boomed through the microphone, and the crowd roared.

I found my spot on the left side. Sally stood beside me, and Mama had pushed through to join us. Tommy stood nearby, off-duty tonight. Even Mr. Gennaro had closed The Melody Box early.

The Bayside Boys launched into their opening number—upbeat and energetic. Peter worked his charismatic magic. Joey and Tommy provided solid harmonies. And Nick, standing at the back in his customary position, held it all together with that deep bass foundation.

I watched him with pride swelling in my chest. My bass singer. My Nick.

The regular set continued—song after song, the ones I'd heard dozens of times this summer. But tonight they sounded final. Like closing chapters.

The romantic ballad came third to last. I closed my eyes, letting the harmonies wash over me. Peter's lead was beautiful as always. But it was Nick's voice underneath that made my chest ache—that deep, steady presence that said safety and home and love.

When the song ended, I opened my eyes to find Nick looking directly at me. Our gazes locked, and something passed between us. A promise, maybe.

The final regular song ended to enthusiastic cheering. Peter let the applause die down before stepping back to the microphone.

"Now, as promised, we've got something special for you tonight. A featured duet performance from two very talented singers." He gestured toward where I stood in the crowd. "Diane Foster and my good friend Nick Romano are going to perform a ballad that Nick wrote specifically for this occasion. Give them a warm Bayshore welcome!"

The crowd erupted. Faces turned toward me. Sally gave me an encouraging push, and suddenly I was walking toward the bandstand, my legs on autopilot while my heart hammered.

Three steps to the stage. I climbed them one at a time, gripping the rail. Then I was on the stage, the crowd stretching before me like an ocean.

The panic started to rise—that familiar terror from the audition, threatening to close my throat.

But then Nick appeared beside me, solid and grounding. His hand found mine, squeezing gently, his thumb tracing that familiar circle.

"Together," he whispered.

"Together," I agreed.

Peter handed Nick the microphone, then stepped back to join Tommy and Joey. For once, Nick would be featured. The one in front.

Nick cleared his throat, and when he spoke into the microphone, his voice carried across the hushed crowd.

"This song is called 'The Foundation.' It's about finding the person who makes you brave enough to step out of the shadows. About recognizing that the best things aren't always the obvious ones. And it's dedicated to Diane, who taught me that sometimes stepping forward is worth the risk."

My eyes filled with tears. Nick set the microphone on its stand between us and took my hand again.

He started the bass line a cappella. His voice filled the evening air, deep and resonant and achingly beautiful. The melody he'd written—simple but emotionally complex, designed to showcase bass and soprano in conversation.

I took a breath and joined in, my voice finding the harmony we'd practiced. My soprano wove around his bass, dancing through the spaces between notes, creating something that was neither his nor mine but ours.

The lyrics told our story. About watching someone from a distance. About stepping forward into fear. About finding harmony where you least expected it.

Behind us, Peter, Tommy, and Joey added subtle harmony supports, but Nick and I were the heart of this performance. The leads. The story.

As we sang, my fear melted away. It didn't matter that hundreds of people were watching. What mattered was Nick beside me, his hand holding mine, our voices blending in the truest thing I'd ever done.

The song built toward its climax, our voices rising together, harmonies layering and intertwining. In that moment—singing beside Nick under the setting sun with the ocean at our backs—I felt completely, perfectly right.

We hit the final note together and held it, letting it fade naturally into the evening air. For a heartbeat, there was absolute silence.

Then the crowd exploded. People were on their feet, cheering and whistling. Mama wiped tears from her eyes. Sally jumped up and down. Mr. Gennaro clapped hard.

But I only saw Nick. The way he was looking at me like we'd just created something magical together.

And maybe we had.

Peter stepped forward to reclaim the microphone, grinning. "That was incredible! Let's hear it again for Diane Foster and Nick Romano!"

More applause. More cheering. But Nick and I stayed frozen in our bubble, hands still joined, faces turned toward each other.

"We did it," I whispered.

"You did it," he corrected. "You were amazing."

"No. We did it. Together."

He smiled—genuine and warm and completely his. No performance, no pretense. Just Nick.

The Bayside Boys moved back into formation for their closing songs, and Nick gently guided me offstage. We descended together, and immediately Sally engulfed me in a crushing hug.

"That was beautiful! You were both so beautiful!"

More people surrounded us—Mama hugging me tight, Mr. Gennaro telling Nick how proud he was, Tommy clapping Nick on the back.

But through it all, Nick never let go of my hand.

And as the Bayside Boys launched into their closing number and the sun began its final descent toward the horizon, I realized something important: This wasn't an ending after all.

This was a beginning.

The real one. The one that counted.

With Nick beside me, I could face whatever came next.
