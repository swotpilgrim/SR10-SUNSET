# Chapter 27: The Kiss

For a moment we just stood there on the moonlit pier, his hands cradling my face, my heart pounding so hard I wondered if he could feel it. The world had narrowed to just us—his dark eyes searching mine, the warmth of his touch, the sound of our breathing mixing with the rhythm of the waves.

"Can I kiss you?" Nick asked softly, his thumb tracing a gentle circle on my cheek.

The question made my breath catch. Even now, even after everything we'd just confessed, he was asking permission. Making sure I wanted this as much as he did.

"Yes," I whispered. "Please."

He smiled—that genuine, unguarded smile that transformed his whole face—and then he leaned in slowly, giving me every opportunity to change my mind. But I didn't want to change my mind. I'd never been more sure of anything.

When his lips finally met mine, it felt like coming home.

The kiss was gentle at first, tentative, like we were both afraid this might be a dream that would dissolve if we moved too fast. His hands stayed cupped around my face, anchoring me, while mine found their way to his shoulders, feeling the solid reality of him under my palms.

But then something shifted. The tentative quality melted away, replaced by something deeper and more certain. Nick kissed me like I was precious and brave and exactly what he wanted. Like he'd been holding back all summer and could finally let himself feel everything.

And I kissed him back with all the love and certainty I'd been too afraid to admit. Trying to show him through this what I'd struggled to say in words—that he was the one I wanted, the one I chose, the one I'd been falling for even when I was too stubborn to see it.

When we finally broke apart, both slightly breathless, Nick rested his forehead against mine. His eyes were still closed, like he was savoring the moment.

"Wow," he murmured.

I laughed softly, giddy with happiness and relief. "Yeah. Wow."

He opened his eyes and looked at me with such tenderness it made my chest ache. "I've wanted to do that for so long. Every time I walked you home, every time you smiled at me while we were practicing, I kept thinking 'just kiss her,' but I was terrified you'd pull away."

"I wouldn't have pulled away," I said. Then I reconsidered, being honest. "Okay, maybe I would have a few weeks ago because I was still being an idiot. But not now. Never now."

"Good." He kissed me again, shorter this time but no less sweet. "Because I'm planning to do that a lot from now on."

"I like that plan very much."

"We should probably go back," Nick said, though he made no move to release me. "People will wonder where we went."

"Let them wonder." But I knew he was right. Our friends would be looking for us.

"Five more minutes?" I asked.

Nick pulled me closer. "Five more minutes."

We stood there swaying slightly, his arms around my waist, my head against his chest where I could hear his heartbeat. He hummed softly—the melody from our duet.

"I love that song," I said.

"I wrote it for you. Before I even knew you'd sing it with me." His chest rumbled with the admission. "About bass and soprano, foundation and flourish, two voices that create something beautiful together."

"We do create something beautiful. Not just musically. This. Us."

"Yeah." He kissed the top of my head. "We really do."

"What happens when summer ends?" The question had been lurking in the back of my mind, and now it tumbled out. "Labor Day is tomorrow. Tourists leave, the boardwalk slows down, everything goes back to normal. What happens to us?"

Nick pulled back slightly so he could look at me. "What do you want to happen?"

"I want this to be real. Not just summer magic that disappears when fall starts. I want us to keep being us—walking and talking and making music together." I met his eyes. "I want you to be my boyfriend. If you want that too."

"I definitely want that too." He was smiling again, that soft genuine smile that was just for me. "Diane Foster, will you be my girlfriend? Officially, not just summer romance?"

"Yes." I kissed him quickly, sealing the agreement. "Yes, absolutely yes."

"Good. Then when summer ends, we keep going. I'll still be here through fall and winter—I'm not leaving for music school until spring. We'll figure out the long distance thing when that happens, but for now we have months. Months of walking and talking and..." he grinned, "and kissing."

"I like how that sounds."

"Me too." He glanced back toward the boardwalk. "But we really should go find Sally and Tommy before they send out a search party. Sally's probably vibrating with curiosity by now."

I laughed because that was absolutely true. "She's going to want every detail."

"Tommy's going to give me so much grief." But Nick looked happy about it, not bothered. "He's been telling me all summer to just tell you how I felt. He's going to be insufferably smug about being right."

"Sally too. She's been Team Nick since the beginning." I took his hand, lacing our fingers together. "Ready to face them?"

"As long as you're with me." He squeezed my hand. "Together?"

"Together."

We walked back down the pier hand in hand, our footsteps echoing on the wooden boards, the moon lighting our path. Behind us, the ocean kept its steady rhythm. Ahead of us, the boardwalk beckoned with light and music and the promise of friends waiting.

As we approached the main boardwalk, I could see the concert area was mostly cleared now. The bandstand stood dark and quiet. Vendors were closing up their carts. Families were heading to cars, their children sleepy and sand-covered.

The end of summer. The end of the season. The end of the Bayside Boys' performances.

But not the end of Nick and me.

Sally spotted us first, standing with Tommy near The Melody Box. When she saw us hand in hand, she squealed.

"I knew it!" She launched herself at me in a crushing hug. "You told him!"

"Of course I said yes," Nick said, grinning at Tommy. "I've been in love with her all summer."

"About time," Tommy said, clapping Nick on the back.

Sally pulled back, eyes shining. "Tell me everything. You kissed, right? Please tell me you kissed."

"We kissed," I confirmed.

"And it was perfect," Nick added, pulling me against his side.

Sally squeaked with delight. Tommy rolled his eyes but smiled.

"You two are disgustingly cute," Tommy said. "Pete's going to be insufferably smug. He said you were perfect for each other from the audition."

"Peter said that?" I asked, surprised.

"He noticed weeks ago. The whole group did. You two were the only ones who didn't see it."

"We were idiots," I admitted.

"But we're idiots together now," Nick said.

Mr. Gennaro emerged from The Melody Box with a paper bag. "Nick! Diane! I have something for you both."

Inside were two records—the jazz albums Nick and I had listened to together. The ones that had taught me to hear music differently.

"Mr. Gennaro, we can't—" Nick started.

"Consider it a gift. You found each other partly because of music—these records are part of your story." The old man's eyes twinkled. "Plus I'm an old romantic. Indulge me."

"Thank you," I said, touched. "For everything."

"That was all you, my dear. I just provided the soundtrack."

Sally extracted a promise that I'd call her tomorrow. Tommy threatened to tell everyone about Nick's "disgustingly romantic" behavior.

Finally, the crowd thinned. The boardwalk lights began shutting off, summer winding down.

"Come on," Nick said, tugging my hand. "I'll walk you home."

"Some things never change," I said, falling into step beside him.

"Some things shouldn't change. This—walking you home, talking about everything and nothing—this is my favorite part of every day."

We walked slowly, in no hurry to reach my house, stretching out the last moments of this perfect night. Nick told me about the songs he was working on, asked about my plans for finishing high school, wondered if I'd ever considered studying music seriously.

"I never thought I was good enough," I admitted. "I always figured singing was just something I did for fun, not something I could do seriously."

"You're more than good enough. You have real talent, Diane. Raw talent that just needs training and confidence." He squeezed my hand. "You should think about it. Voice lessons at least. Maybe college for music if that's something you want."

"Maybe," I said, the idea taking root. A few months ago I would have dismissed it as impossible. But now, after stepping onto that stage, after singing in front of hundreds of people, after choosing to be brave? Maybe it wasn't so impossible after all.

We reached my house too soon. The lights were on in the front window—Mama waiting up, probably dying of curiosity about how tonight went.

"So," Nick said, stopping at the bottom of my porch steps. "Same time tomorrow?"

"Labor Day concert?" I asked.

"No concert tomorrow. The season's over. But maybe we could do something? Go to the beach, or back to The Melody Box, or just walk and talk?" He looked almost shy. "Our first official date as boyfriend and girlfriend?"

"I'd love that. All of that." I stepped closer, going up on my toes to kiss him softly. "Pick me up at noon?"

"I'll be here." He kissed me again, lingering this time. "Goodnight, Diane."

"Goodnight, Nick."

I watched him walk away until he turned the corner and disappeared from view. Then I climbed the porch steps and went inside, my heart so full it felt like it might burst.

Mama was waiting in the living room, a knowing smile on her face.

"So," she said. "How did it go?"

I sank onto the couch beside her, grinning so wide my cheeks hurt. "It went perfectly. Absolutely perfectly."

And then I told her everything.
