# Chapter 12: The Melody Box

Saturday afternoon found me walking to The Melody Box for our weekly rehearsal with a strange mixture of nerves and anticipation. Not about the singing—that had become easier each week. But about seeing Nick, about being alone with him in that small back room, about the something unnamed that was growing between us.

The bell chimed when I entered, and Mr. Gennaro greeted me with his usual warm smile.

"Afternoon, Miss Foster. Nick's in back already, setting up."

"Thank you, Mr. Gennaro."

I made my way through the familiar maze of record shelves to the back room. Nick was there as promised, organizing sheet music and adjusting the record player. He looked up when I entered, and his whole face brightened.

"Hey. Right on time."

"Have I ever been late?"

"No, but I still wait for you like you might not show up." He said it lightly, but there was an edge of vulnerability underneath.

"I'll always show up," I said, meaning more than just rehearsals.

Something flickered in his eyes—understanding, hope. "Good to know."

We went through our usual warm-ups, running scales and breathing exercises that had become comfortable routine. But today, Nick had something different planned.

"I want to try something new," he said after we'd finished our second run-through of the duet. "We've been practicing the ballad for weeks, and you've got it down solid. But I think we should add a second song to our set."

"A second song?" My stomach clenched with fresh anxiety. "The competition was for one duet."

"I know. But I talked to Peter, and he said if we wanted to do something extra, we could. Make it a real featured segment instead of just one song." Nick pulled out a new piece of sheet music. "This is something I've been working on. An original."

I took the paper, studying the notation and lyrics. It was simpler than the ballad, more intimate. A conversation between two voices rather than a performance.

"You wrote this?"

"Yeah. It's... it's about finding someone when you weren't looking for them. About how the best things show up when you stop chasing what you think you want." He looked embarrassed. "It's probably too personal to perform, but I thought—"

"It's beautiful." I read through the lyrics again, my throat tight. The song was about us. Maybe he didn't say it explicitly, but it was there in every line.

"You think we could make it work?" Nick asked.

"I think we have to try."

He taught me the melody slowly, patiently. It was written for my voice specifically—nothing too high or technically complex, just honest and true. His bass line underneath created a foundation that made the whole thing feel like a conversation, like two people discovering each other through music.

We ran through it three times, and by the third attempt, we'd found the rhythm. Our voices wove together naturally, creating harmonies that felt inevitable rather than constructed.

When the last note faded, we stood in silence for a moment.

"That felt..." I couldn't find words for what it felt like.

"Real," Nick finished. "It felt real."

I set down the sheet music with trembling hands. "Nick, this song. It's about us, isn't it?"

He could have denied it. Made it about something abstract or universal. But he didn't.

"Yeah. It's about you. About how I spent all summer being invisible, and then you saw me. About how I didn't expect that, didn't plan for it, but now I can't imagine going back to how things were before."

My heart was racing. "I feel that too. Like everything's different now."

"Good different?"

"The best different."

We were standing very close now, close enough that I could see the flecks of gold in his dark eyes, could feel the warmth radiating from him. This was the moment—the one I'd been both anticipating and avoiding for weeks.

Nick reached up slowly, giving me time to pull away if I wanted. His hand cupped my cheek gently, his thumb brushing across my cheekbone.

"I really want to kiss you," he said quietly. "But only if you want that too."

"I want that too," I whispered.

He leaned in slowly, carefully, like I was something precious that might break. When his lips met mine, it was soft and sweet and nothing like I'd imagined my first kiss would be.

It was better.

There were no fireworks, no dramatic swells of music. Just warmth and rightness and the feeling of finally, finally finding something I'd been searching for without knowing it.

When we pulled apart, Nick was smiling.

"I've wanted to do that for weeks," he admitted.

"Why didn't you?"

"Wanted to make sure you felt the same way. Wanted it to be right, not rushed." He tucked a strand of hair behind my ear. "Was it worth the wait?"

"Definitely."

We spent the rest of rehearsal alternating between practicing our songs and stealing small kisses in between. Everything felt easier now, lighter. Like acknowledging what was between us had released some pressure valve I didn't know existed.

By the time we finished, it was late afternoon. The sun slanted through the high windows of The Melody Box, painting everything golden.

"Walk you home?" Nick asked, just like he did every evening after performances.

"Always."

We said goodbye to Mr. Gennaro and stepped out onto the boardwalk. Nick took my hand immediately, and I laced my fingers through his, marveling at how natural it felt.

"So what does this make us?" I asked as we walked.

"I don't know. What do you want it to make us?"

"More than friends?"

"Definitely more than friends." He squeezed my hand. "How about we're Diane and Nick, and we're figuring it out as we go?"

"I like that."

We walked slowly, in no hurry to reach my building. The boardwalk was busy with Saturday tourists, families and couples and groups of teenagers. We navigated through them, wrapped in our own private world.

"My family wants to meet you," Nick said. "Before the Labor Day show. Proper introduction, dinner at the house, the whole thing."

The thought made me nervous and excited in equal measure. "That's a big step."

"Too big?"

"No. Just big." I thought about it. "I'd like to meet them. As long as your nonna promises not to start planning our wedding."

Nick laughed. "I'll try to prepare her, but no promises. She's already decided we're perfect for each other based purely on my descriptions."

"What have you been telling her?"

"That you're beautiful and smart and you listen to the bass line. That's all it took to win her over."

"You think I'm beautiful?"

He stopped walking, turning to face me. "Have you looked in a mirror lately? Of course I think you're beautiful."

I'd never thought of myself that way. Pretty maybe, on good days. But beautiful seemed like a word for girls like Barbara Wellington, who commanded attention just by existing.

"You make me feel beautiful," I said. "That's different than being beautiful."

"No, it's just that I see you the way you actually are, and you're finally believing it." He brushed his thumb across my knuckles. "Come to dinner next Sunday. Meet the chaos that is the Romano family. Let my nonna embarrass me with baby stories."

"Okay. I'd love to."

We resumed walking, and conversation flowed easily—about his family, about the upcoming performance, about what would happen after summer ended. The future felt less scary now, more like possibility than threat.

When we reached Foster's Flowers, Nick pulled me into the little alcove beside the shop door, out of view of Mama's window.

"Can I kiss you again?" he asked.

"You don't have to ask every time."

"I want to. Consent is important."

I answered by standing on my tiptoes and kissing him first. He made a soft sound of surprise and happiness, pulling me closer, and for a few perfect moments, nothing existed except the two of us and the magic we were creating.

When we finally pulled apart, both slightly breathless, Nick rested his forehead against mine.

"I'm falling for you," he said quietly. "I need you to know that. This isn't just summer fun for me. It's real."

"It's real for me too." I pulled back enough to look into his eyes. "I spent all summer chasing a fantasy. But this—you—you're better than any fantasy I could have imagined."

His smile was radiant. "Good. Because I don't plan on being temporary."

We said goodnight reluctantly, stealing one more kiss before I forced myself to actually go inside. I climbed the stairs feeling like I was floating, my lips still tingling, my heart so full it might burst.

Mama was waiting with that knowing smile.

"Good rehearsal?"

"The best." I couldn't stop smiling. "We're adding a second song to our set. Something Nick wrote."

"That's wonderful. And?"

"And what?"

"And what else happened? You're glowing, sweetheart."

I sat down beside her, the happiness too big to contain. "He kissed me. And Mama, it was perfect. He was perfect. Everything about it was perfect."

She pulled me into a hug. "I'm so happy for you, honey. Nick's a good young man."

"He invited me to Sunday dinner with his family. To meet everyone properly."

"That's a big step."

"I know. But I want to. I want to be part of his life, not just the summer version of it."

Mama pulled back, studying my face with an expression I couldn't quite read. "You're serious about him."

"Is that okay?"

"More than okay. You deserve someone who sees you and values you and treats you right. Nick seems to do all three."

That night, I lay in bed replaying every moment of the afternoon. The new song, the kiss, the hand-holding walk home. The promise of something real and lasting.

For the first time since signing up for that audition, I wasn't terrified of the Labor Day performance. Because it wasn't about Peter anymore, or about proving something, or about stepping out of invisibility.

It was about sharing something beautiful with Nick. About showing everyone what we'd created together.

About being seen and choosing to be seen and finding that it wasn't scary at all when the right person was looking.

I fell asleep smiling, my last thought a simple truth I'd spent all summer learning:

Sometimes the best thing isn't the one you're chasing. Sometimes it's the one that quietly steps beside you and offers to walk you home.
