# Chapter 26: Backstage Confession

"I've been an idiot," I started, the words tumbling out. "Sally's been telling me for weeks and she's absolutely right. I wasted the entire summer chasing a fantasy when you were right there the whole time being real and genuine and everything I actually needed."

Nick's hands tightened on the railing, but he didn't speak.

I forced myself to slow down, to take a breath. He deserved this said properly.

"I fell for Peter before I even knew him. Saw him performing that first Fourth of July weekend and fixated—built him up into this perfect person in my head." I paused, gathering courage. "It was safe, you know? Crushing from a distance. I could daydream without ever having to risk anything real. Without having to be vulnerable."

The waves crashed below us, filling the silence.

"The audition—I froze. Was about to run offstage in humiliation." I met his eyes. "But you stepped forward. Gave me your voice to hold onto when I couldn't find my own."

"I just didn't want you to be embarrassed," he said quietly.

"You gave me something solid when everything felt like it was falling apart. Your bass line was a foundation I could build on. Our voices just fit together. Like they belonged that way."

His expression softened slightly, walls cracking.

"After that, you kept showing up. Walking me home, talking about music and family and dreams. Really listening, asking questions like you genuinely cared." I twisted my hands. "And I loved those walks, Nick. Loved talking to you. Started looking forward to them more than anything."

"I looked forward to them too," he admitted.

"But I was too stubborn to see what that meant. Kept telling myself you were just being nice. Kept focused on Peter because that fantasy was safer than admitting I was developing real feelings for you."

I took a breath.

"Real feelings are terrifying. They require being truly seen—not just the performed version, but all of it. The awkward parts, the insecure parts. And being seen like that means risking rejection."

Nick's eyes widened slightly, understanding.

"Peter could never reject me because he never knew me. It was all surface. He talked at me, never asked what I thought or felt. I was just an audience. And part of me was grateful because it meant I didn't have to be brave."

The admission hurt.

"But you were different. You actually saw me, Nick. Noticed when I was listening to the music, not just watching the show. Remembered things I said. Shared your music—the songs you wrote, the records you loved. You let me see the real you, and that made me want to be brave enough to let you see the real me."

"I always saw the real you," Nick said softly. "From that first night when you stood in the crowd actually hearing the harmonies. You were... you are beautiful, Diane. Not just how you look, but who you are when you're not trying to be anything except yourself."

Tears pricked my eyes. "Then why did I keep choosing Peter?"

"I don't know. Why did you?"

"Because I was scared. Because Peter was the safe choice—the crush that meant nothing. But you..." I stepped closer. "You required courage. Being with you meant being vulnerable and real. Risking my heart instead of just daydreaming."

I was close enough now to see the gold flecks in his dark eyes.

"And then Peter finally asked me out, and I said yes because I thought that's what I wanted. The fantasy becoming reality."

"But it wasn't what you wanted," Nick said.

"No. Both dates were awful—not because Peter did anything terrible, but because there was nothing there. No real connection, no foundation. Just surface shine." I paused. "And all I could think about was how much better it felt talking to you. How much more real everything was with you."

His expression shifted slightly, walls lowering.

"I should have canceled that first date. Should have said no. But I'd spent all summer convinced he was what I wanted, too stubborn to admit I was wrong." My voice caught. "And I hurt you. Canceled on your family dinner. Made you feel like a consolation prize. I'm so sorry, Nick."

"Were you choosing me because Peter disappointed you?" he asked carefully. "Because that's what I need to know. I can't be the person you settle for when the fantasy fails. I can't be second best."

"You're not second best," I said fiercely. "You were never second. You were the choice I was too scared to make because it mattered too much. Because choosing you meant choosing something real, and real things can actually hurt you when they end."

I moved closer, close enough to feel the warmth radiating from him.

"I fell in love with you, Nick. Completely, terrifyingly in love with you. Not because Peter disappointed me, but because you make me feel seen in a way no one else ever has. Because your music moves me. Because talking to you feels like coming home. Because you stepped forward when I was frozen with fear."

His breath caught.

"You love me?" His voice was barely a whisper.

"Yes. I love you." Saying it felt like jumping off a cliff—terrifying and irrevocable. "I love how you hear music in layers others miss. How you care more about making something beautiful than getting credit. How you actually listen. How you stepped into the spotlight tonight even though it scared you."

The words kept coming.

"I love your genuine laugh. How you talk about your family with such affection even when they embarrass you. How you let me see your real self instead of performing." I paused. "And I'm terrified because you might not feel the same way, but I had to be brave enough to tell you the truth."

Silence fell. The waves crashed. Music drifted from the distant boardwalk. And Nick stared at me with an expression I couldn't quite read—shock and wonder and something that might have been joy.

"You really mean that," he said finally. "You actually love me."

"Yes. More than I knew I could love anyone." I tried to smile through my nervousness. "I know it's only been a few weeks, maybe too fast, but it's true. I love you, Nick Romano. You're not my second choice. You're the person I choose. The person I want to choose, every single day, if you'll let me."

He stared at me, his dark eyes searching my face. Looking for truth. For certainty.

And I met his gaze steadily, letting him see everything—all the love and fear and hope. Letting him see the real me, vulnerable and unguarded and refusing to hide.

"Say something," I whispered. "Please. Even if it's no, just... say something."

Nick reached out and cupped my face in his hands, his palms warm against my cheeks, his thumbs brushing away tears I hadn't realized were falling.

"Diane," he said, and my name sounded like a prayer. "I've been in love with you since the first time I saw you actually listening to the music. Since before the audition. I've loved you through every walk home and every moment you looked at Peter instead of me. I loved you even when I was trying not to, even when I thought I didn't have a chance."

Hope flared so bright in my chest it hurt.

"And I wanted to believe tonight during the duet that you were singing to me, that you meant what I thought you meant. But I've been disappointed before." His voice went soft, vulnerable. "I've spent this whole summer watching you want someone else. So I need to know you're sure. I need to know you're choosing me because I'm what you actually want."

"You're what I want," I said with absolute certainty. "Not what I should want or what's convenient or what makes logical sense. You're what I actually, truly want. You're the bass line, Nick. You're the foundation that holds everything together and makes it beautiful. And I was listening to the wrong voice all summer, focused on the flashy lead when I should have been hearing the steady harmony underneath. But I hear you now. I choose you."

He studied my face for another heartbeat, searching for any hint of doubt or uncertainty. And then—finally, finally—his expression transformed. The careful walls crumbled completely, revealing everything underneath. Love and joy and wonder and relief all at once.

"Then I choose you too," he whispered. "God, Diane, I choose you too."

And the way he was looking at me—like I was precious and brave and exactly what he wanted—made me feel like the person I'd been trying to become all summer.

The person who was brave enough to choose real love over safe fantasy.

The person who could stand on a moonlit pier and confess everything to the boy she loved, even terrified of his answer.

And now, standing there with Nick's hands cradling my face and his eyes full of love, I finally understood:

The real magic wasn't in the fantasy. It was in this. In choosing truth over illusion. In finding someone who saw you completely and loved you anyway.

In finding the foundation that held everything together.

"So what happens now?" I asked, barely breathing.

Nick smiled—that genuine, unguarded smile I'd fallen in love with. "Now we figure this out together."

"I like the sound of that."

"Me too." He pulled me closer. "Me too."
