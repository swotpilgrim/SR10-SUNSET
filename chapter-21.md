# Chapter 21: The Final Performance Approaches

Monday morning dawned gray and humid, the air heavy with the promise of late-August storms. I woke with an ache in my chest that had nothing to do with the weather.

Labor Day weekend was nine days away. Nine days until the Bayside Boys' final performance. Nine days until summer ended and everything changed.

Nine days to fix what I'd broken with Nick.

At breakfast, Mama set the newspaper in front of me with her coffee pot in hand. The local events section showed an advertisement for the end-of-summer concert: "Bayside Boys Final Show—Labor Day Saturday—Special Guest Performances." Below it, smaller print listed my name alongside Nick's for the featured duet.

My featured duet with Nick. The performance we'd been practicing for all summer—back when things between us were simple and uncomplicated. Back when I hadn't made a mess of everything by chasing the wrong person.

"Have you talked to him?" Mama asked, refilling my coffee cup. Steam rose between us.

"Not really. Not since Friday when he said he needed time to think. To trust that I'm serious about this." I traced the rim of my cup with one finger. "About us."

"And are you? Serious?"

"More than I've been about anything." I pushed the newspaper away, unable to look at our names printed side by side. "But I don't know how to prove that to him. Words aren't enough after everything I've done. After choosing Peter first, after cancelling on his family dinner, after—"

"Then show him through actions," Mama interrupted gently. "Consistency. Being there even when it's uncomfortable. Trust takes time to rebuild, honey. You can't rush it, but you can earn it back."

I nodded, though the thought of eight more days in this limbo made my chest ache. Eight days of not knowing if Nick would forgive me. Eight days until we had to perform together—either as two people who'd found their way back to each other, or as two people pretending everything was fine for the sake of the show.

That evening, I went to the boardwalk early as usual. The Bayside Boys' announcement came right before their first song—Peter stepping to the microphone with his characteristic showman's energy.

"Evening, Bayshore! We've got some bittersweet news tonight." He paused for dramatic effect. "This Saturday will be our final performance of the summer. Labor Day weekend, folks. End of the season."

Murmurs rippled through the crowd. These nightly performances had become summer institution—their ending marked the close of boardwalk magic.

"But we're going out with a bang!" Peter continued. "Extended set, special songs, and our featured duet performers." He gestured toward where I stood in the crowd. "Diane Foster and Nick Romano will be singing together. Should be a great show!"

Applause scattered through the audience. Several people turned to look at me. I forced a smile, feeling more pressure than excitement.

Eight days to perform a duet with someone who wasn't sure he could trust me. Eight days to prove my feelings were real.

Eight days before summer ended and Nick might walk out of my life forever.

The performance started, and I watched Nick with single-minded focus. He seemed more present tonight than he had been all week—less withdrawn, more engaged with the music. Once or twice, I thought he glanced my direction, but I couldn't be certain.

After the show, I didn't approach him. Gave him the space he'd asked for, even though it hurt. But as I turned to leave, his voice stopped me.

"Diane?"

I spun around. Nick stood a few feet away, hands in his pockets, expression uncertain.

"Hey."

"Hey." He shifted his weight. "We should probably practice. Before Saturday. We haven't rehearsed the duet in weeks."

Hope flared in my chest, but I kept my voice neutral. "When works for you?"

"Tomorrow afternoon? At The Melody Box?"

"I'll be there. Two o'clock?"

"Yeah. Two o'clock." He hesitated like he wanted to say more, then just nodded. "See you then."

I walked home feeling lighter than I had in days. He'd initiated contact. Wanted to practice. That had to mean something.

Tuesday afternoon, I arrived at The Melody Box five minutes early, my stomach full of butterflies. Mr. Gennaro greeted me with his warm smile.

"Miss Foster! Nick's in the back room waiting for you."

I made my way through the familiar maze of records to the back room. Nick was setting up the record player, his back to the door.

"Hey," I said softly.

He turned, and for a moment we just looked at each other. Then he gestured to the chairs arranged facing each other.

"Let's run through the ballad first. See where we're at."

We went through the song twice, and it felt... off. Not technically—our voices still blended beautifully. But the emotional connection that had made our audition special was buried under tension and uncertainty.

After the second run-through, Nick stopped the record player.

"This isn't working."

"I know." I twisted my hands together. "It feels mechanical."

"Because we're both thinking too much. Trying to be professional instead of just... connecting through the music." He sat in his chair, running a hand through his hair. "The only reason we won the competition was because of our chemistry. Without that, we're just two people singing the same song."

"How do we get that back?"

Nick met my eyes directly. "By being honest. By trusting each other. By remembering why we wanted to do this in the first place."

"I wanted to do it with you," I said quietly. "Not with Peter or the group. With you specifically."

"Even at the audition? When you were still focused on Peter?"

"I didn't realize it then, but yes. Even then." I leaned forward in my chair. "Nick, I know you need time to trust me again. I know I hurt you and words aren't enough. But working on this duet together—maybe that's how we rebuild. Through the music. The way we connected in the first place."

He was quiet for a long moment, studying my face. Then slowly, carefully, he reached across the space between us and took my hand.

"Let's try again. But this time, let's forget about performing. Let's just... sing to each other. The way we did during the audition. When it was just us and the music."

We stood and positioned ourselves closer than before. Nick started the bass line without accompaniment, just his voice filling the small room—deep and steady and achingly familiar. The sound wrapped around me like a blanket, like safety, like home.

I joined in, and this time I sang to him—not to an audience, not to prove anything, just honest communication through music. My soprano wove around his bass, finding the harmonies we'd practiced but imbuing them with something new. Something raw and true.

The lyrics took on new meaning as we sang them, each line a confession. Each note a promise. Our voices blended and separated and came back together, dancing around each other in a conversation that needed no words.

By the time we finished, we were both slightly breathless, standing close enough that I could see gold flecks in his dark eyes. Close enough that I could feel the warmth radiating from him. Close enough that the space between us felt charged with possibility.

"That was better," Nick said softly.

"Much better."

His hand was still holding mine. Neither of us moved to break contact.

"I've missed you," he admitted. "This whole week of keeping distance—it's been hell. But I needed to know I wasn't just convenient. That you actually chose me."

"I choose you," I said with absolute certainty. "Not because Peter disappointed me. Not because you're safe or convenient. I choose you because you make me feel truly seen. Because being with you feels like the most honest thing I've ever done."

Nick's other hand came up to cup my cheek, his thumb brushing across my cheekbone. "Can I kiss you?"

"Please."

He kissed me softly, carefully, and it felt like reconciliation. Like forgiveness. Like beginning again but with clearer understanding.

When we pulled apart, he rested his forehead against mine.

"I love you," he whispered. "I've been trying not to, but I can't help it."

"I love you too. So much it scares me."

"Good scared or bad scared?"

"Good scared. The kind that means it matters."

We practiced for another hour, and the duet came together beautifully. The emotional truth we'd rediscovered carried through every note, every harmony, every shared breath.

Walking home that evening—him actually walking me home again, finally—Nick took my hand.

"Eight days until the performance."

"I know." My stomach fluttered with nerves. "Are you worried?"

"A little. But not about the music. The music part we can do." He squeezed my hand. "I'm worried about after. About what happens when summer ends and this"—he gestured between us—"has to exist in the real world instead of summer magic."

"Then we make it real," I said simply. "No more fantasy, no more pretending. Just us, figuring it out together."

"You make it sound easy."

"It won't be easy. But it'll be real. And real is better."

He stopped walking and pulled me close, kissing me right there on the boardwalk as tourists passed and evening settled around us.

"Eight days," he repeated when we broke apart. "Let's make them count."

And for the first time since this whole complicated summer began, I felt like we actually would.
