# Chapter 2: The Crush Deepens

The morning sun streamed through the front windows of Foster's Flowers, catching water droplets on the roses and turning them into tiny prisms. I hummed while I worked, last night's melody still playing in my head like a record I couldn't stop.

"You're in a good mood this morning," Mrs. Chen said as I wrapped her carnations. "Special occasion?"

"Just a nice summer day," I replied. That was the thing about having a secret crush—it made ordinary mornings feel special, like carrying around something precious nobody else could see.

Mrs. Chen paid and left, and I returned to arranging the display window. The brass bell chimed again, and I looked up to see Sally Brennan breezing through the door, still wearing her uniform from the arcade—a white blouse with "Bayshore Amusements" embroidered on the pocket.

"Morning break," she announced, perching on the stool behind the counter. "Tell me you brought lunch today because I'm starving and I refuse to eat another boardwalk hot dog."

"There's a sandwich in the back room," I said. "Mama made extra."

"Your mother is a saint." Sally disappeared into the back and returned a moment later with half a ham sandwich. She took a bite and studied me with those sharp eyes that never missed anything. "So. The Bayside Boys again last night?"

I felt my cheeks warm. "I just went for a walk."

"Uh-huh. A walk that happened to end at the bandstand at exactly seven o'clock." Sally grinned. "Diane Foster, you've got it bad."

"I don't know what you mean," I said primly, focusing very hard on arranging baby's breath around the edges of the vase.

"Peter Castellano. Dark hair, dreamy smile, sings like an angel. Ring any bells?"

I tried to suppress my smile and failed. Sally laughed.

"I knew it! You're hopeless. How long has this been going on?"

"Since the Fourth of July," I admitted. "The first time I saw them perform. He's just... he's so..."

"Dreamy?" Sally supplied. "Keen? The cat's meow?"

"All of those things." I sighed, setting down my scissors. "And completely out of my league."

Sally made an exasperated sound. "That's ridiculous. You're pretty and smart and you have actual talents beyond looking good in a sweater. Why don't you just talk to him?"

"Talk to him?" I stared at her like she'd suggested I fly to the moon. "Sally, I can't just walk up to Peter Castellano and start a conversation. He doesn't even know I exist."

"Well, he won't if you keep standing in the crowd like a wallflower. You need to actually do something."

"Like what?"

"I don't know. Ask him about the music. Tell him you like their songs. Buy him a Coca-Cola." Sally waved her sandwich for emphasis. "Anything besides staring at him from a distance every single night."

"I don't stare."

"You absolutely stare. I've seen you. You get this look on your face like you're watching the second coming." She softened her tone. "I'm not trying to be mean, Di. I just think you're wasting your summer on a fantasy. Either talk to the guy or move on."

I turned back to my arrangement, tucking stems into place with more force than necessary. "It's not a fantasy. It's... it's..."

"Hopeless?"

"Romantic," I corrected, though her word felt more accurate.

Sally sighed. "Okay. But don't come crying to me when summer ends and you've spent three months mooning over a boy who doesn't know your name."

We moved on to other topics—Sally's complaints about her boss at the arcade, the new Doris Day movie at the Strand, whether we should try to get to the beach on Sunday. But her words stayed with me after she left, a small uncomfortable truth I didn't want to examine too closely.

Was I wasting my summer?

I pushed the thought away and focused on work. Customers came and went. I made corsages for a sweet sixteen party, assembled a sympathy arrangement, helped a nervous young man choose flowers for a first date. Mama worked in the back room on the Henderson anniversary piece, occasionally calling out to ask my opinion on ribbon colors or flower placement.

By six o'clock, I'd almost convinced myself not to go. Sally was right—standing in a crowd watching a boy who didn't notice me was pathetic. I should stay home, help Mama with dinner, act like a normal person instead of a lovesick fool.

But when I locked the shop door, my feet knew exactly where they were going.

The evening was perfect—warm with a breeze that smelled like salt and summer. I arrived at the bandstand with ten minutes to spare.

The crowd was already forming. I found my spot on the left side, third row back, and tried not to look too eager. Around me, other girls chatted and laughed, fixing their hair and reapplying lipstick like they were preparing for something important. Barbara Wellington stood at her usual position front and center, wearing a yellow sundress that made her look like sunshine.

The Bayside Boys arrived right on time, climbing the bandstand steps with easy confidence. My heart did its familiar leap when Peter stepped to the microphone.

Tonight he wore a light blue shirt that matched his eyes, and his smile seemed even brighter than usual. Or maybe I was just paying more attention. I studied everything about him—the way he adjusted the microphone, how he nodded to the others before starting, the casual grace of his movements.

"Evening, Bayshore!" His voice wrapped around us like warm honey. "Ready for some music?"

The crowd cheered. Peter grinned and counted off the first song.

I'd heard these songs a dozen times already, but tonight I listened with new intensity. I watched how Peter's expressions changed with the lyrics, turning tender during the romantic parts and playful during the upbeat sections. I noticed when he made eye contact with different sections of the audience, creating that illusion of intimacy that made everyone feel special.

During the second song, a faster number about hot rods and summer nights, Peter moved around the small stage with energy that bordered on dancing. The other Bayside Boys swayed in place, providing the harmonies that made the sound complete. I barely noticed them. My attention was locked on Peter.

The third song was the romantic ballad—my favorite. Peter's voice dropped into that intimate register, gripping the microphone stand. When he sang about "the girl who makes my heart race," he looked out with those blue eyes, and I felt the world tilt.

For just a moment, his gaze passed over my section of the crowd.

My breath caught. Did he see me?

Of course he wasn't looking at me. He was looking at everyone and no one, performing the way performers do. But my foolish heart didn't care about logic.

I closed my eyes and let the music wash over me. This feeling of possibility, of magic—this was what I needed. The melody soared and Peter's voice climbed with it.

This was what love felt like. It had to be.

The song ended. The crowd erupted in applause, and I clapped until my palms stung. Peter took a small bow, his smile bright and genuine.

"You folks are swell," he said into the microphone. "We'll be back tomorrow night. Bring your friends!"

The Bayside Boys descended from the bandstand, and immediately the crowd surged forward. Girls clustered around Peter, all talking at once, asking for autographs or just trying to get close. Barbara Wellington was right at the front, her hand on Peter's arm, saying something that made him laugh.

I stayed where I was. What would I even say? I was just another face in the crowd, another girl with a crush on the handsome lead singer. Nothing special. Nothing that would make him notice me.

But I couldn't make myself leave yet. I lingered at the edge of the dispersing crowd, watching. Peter was gracious with everyone, signing the backs of performance flyers, posing for a photograph with two giggling girls. He seemed to genuinely enjoy the attention, soaking it up like sunshine.

Tommy Morrison and Joey Moretti packed up the equipment with practiced efficiency. The bass singer—I really needed to learn his name—stood to one side, coiling cables. Nobody clustered around him asking for autographs. He didn't seem to mind.

Eventually, the crowd thinned. Peter shook hands with a few more admirers, then turned to rejoin his group. As he walked past where I stood, close enough that I could have reached out and touched his sleeve, he flashed a smile in my direction.

"Thanks for coming out," he said—not to me specifically, but to the general area where several people stood.

Still, he'd smiled. Near me. Almost at me.

It was enough to make my heart soar.

I waited until the Bayside Boys left, then started home. The boardwalk settled into its evening rhythm—couples strolling hand in hand, families heading to the diner.

I hummed the romantic ballad, replaying the evening. The way Peter had looked during that song. The smile he'd flashed. The possibility—however remote—that maybe he'd noticed me.

Back at the apartment, Mama was setting the table for dinner.

"How was your walk, honey?"

"Nice," I said, which was an understatement. "The weather's perfect."

She gave me a knowing look but didn't push. "Wash up. Dinner's almost ready."

In my bedroom, I pulled out the small wooden box where I kept the performance flyers I'd collected. Each one advertised the Bayside Boys' nightly shows at the bandstand, with a photograph of the four of them arranged in a promotional pose. Peter stood in front, of course, his smile captured perfectly.

I added tonight's flyer to the collection, running my finger over Peter's photographed face.

"This is silly," I whispered to myself. "You're being silly."

But I tucked the box back under my bed anyway, and when I closed my eyes that night, I dreamed about blue eyes and a voice like honey and a smile that felt like sunshine.

Tomorrow, I told myself. Tomorrow I'd be braver. Tomorrow I'd find a way to talk to him, to make him see me.

Tomorrow.

Even though I knew I'd probably say the same thing the night after that, and the night after that, until summer ended and the Bayside Boys moved on to some other town and I was left with nothing but a box of flyers and the memory of a crush that never went anywhere.

But tonight, lying in the dark with the distant sound of waves through my open window, I let myself believe the fantasy.

It was easier than facing the truth.
