# Chapter 1: The Summer Routine

The brass bell above Foster's Flowers chimed as the last customer of the day stepped out onto the boardwalk, a bouquet of yellow roses cradled in her arms. I turned the lock and flipped the sign to "Closed," watching through the window as she disappeared into the early evening crowd. Six o'clock on the dot, just like every other day this summer.

I moved through my closing routine with practiced efficiency—counting the register, organizing ribbon spools by color, sweeping stray petals from the worn wooden floor. My hands knew the motions by heart, leaving my mind free to wander where it had wandered every evening since the Fourth of July. To the central bandstand. To the music. To him.

"Diane, honey, are you coming home for dinner?" My mother's voice drifted from the back room where she was finishing a large arrangement for the Hendersons' anniversary party.

"I'll eat later, Mama," I called back, tucking the cash box under the counter. "I'm just going to take a walk."

I didn't mention where. I didn't need to. She knew.

The boardwalk stretched before me like a wooden ribbon along the Atlantic coast, half a mile of summer joy packed into weathered planks and salt-soaked air. The sun hung low over the water, painting everything gold and pink, and tourists streamed past me heading toward dinner or back to their rental cottages. I walked against the flow, drawn like a magnet toward the music I could already hear in my mind.

My saddle shoes made soft sounds against the boards, and I breathed in the familiar perfume of Bayshore in summer—fried clams from the seafood shack, coconut suntan oil, sugar from the candy shop, and underneath it all, the clean salt smell of the ocean. Above me, strings of lights waited to blink on at dusk, ready to transform the boardwalk into something magical.

I was early, but I always was. Being early meant claiming my spot—close enough to see clearly but not so close that I'd be conspicuous. Not that anyone would notice me anyway. I was just another girl in a full cotton skirt and neat white blouse, my dark hair pulled back with a blue ribbon that matched my skirt. Invisible. Safe.

The central bandstand rose up in the middle of the boardwalk like a gazebo, its white-painted railings and peaked roof decorated with red, white, and blue bunting left over from Independence Day. Folding chairs sat empty in neat rows, waiting for the older folks who'd arrive with their beach chairs and thermoses. Most people stood, especially the teenagers who clustered near the front.

I took my usual position on the left side, third row back, next to the railing where I could lean if my legs got tired. Other girls were already gathering, their voices bright with anticipation. I recognized some from previous nights—the tall redhead with the green scarf, the blonde twins who always wore matching outfits, the cluster of girls who worked at the arcade down the boardwalk.

And Barbara Wellington, of course. She stood front and center in a sundress that probably cost more than my entire summer wardrobe, her perfect blonde curls catching the evening light. Barbara's family owned one of the big beach houses on the north end. She didn't work at a flower shop. She didn't work anywhere. She just existed, beautiful and confident, exactly the kind of girl who deserved to be noticed.

The kind of girl Peter Castellano would notice.

A ripple went through the crowd, and my heart kicked up its rhythm. They were here.

Four young men climbed the steps to the bandstand, and the evening tilted into focus. They wore matching outfits—white short-sleeved shirts with the collars turned up, dark slacks with sharp creases, thin black ties. Their hair was slicked back with pomade, catching the golden light.

Peter stepped to the microphone first, and I forgot to breathe.

He was beautiful. There was no other word for it. Dark hair, strong jawline, and a smile that made you feel like you were the only person in the world when it turned your direction. Which it never did, not toward me, but I could imagine.

"Good evening, Bayshore!" His voice rolled out smooth as honey, and the crowd responded with applause and a few whistles. "We're the Bayside Boys, and we're here to make your summer a little more groovy."

I smiled at the word choice. Groovy. It was new slang, the kind that made parents shake their heads but made everything feel modern and exciting.

The other three took their positions behind Peter. Tommy Morrison stood to his left, tall and lanky with an easy grin. Joey Moretti positioned himself to the right, older than the others, already graduated and heading to college in the fall. And at the back, almost in shadow—

I didn't know his name. The bass singer. He was quieter than the others, less flashy. Dark hair like Peter's but without the pomade shine, and a serious expression that rarely shifted into a smile. He stood with his hands clasped in front of him, waiting.

The music started—someone's record player hidden behind the bandstand, the instrumental track crackling through a speaker. Peter snapped his fingers to the beat, his whole body moving with easy rhythm, and then he began to sing.

"When the sun goes down on the boardwalk, baby..."

His voice wrapped around the melody like silk, smooth and confident. The other three joined in on the harmony, their voices blending into that perfect doo-wop sound that had taken over the radio this summer. The bass singer's voice was so deep I felt it more than heard it, a foundation that held everything else up.

I closed my eyes and let the music wash over me. This was what I came for every night—this feeling of being lifted out of my ordinary life and set down somewhere magical. Where a boy like Peter Castellano might look out into the crowd and see me. Where something exciting might happen. Where summer felt endless and full of possibility.

The first song ended to enthusiastic applause. Peter grinned and launched into the second number without pause, this one faster, encouraging the crowd to clap along. I watched his face, the way his expressions shifted with the lyrics, how he made eye contact with different sections of the audience. During the bridge, he winked at a cluster of girls near the front. They shrieked with delight.

My stomach clenched with something ugly and familiar. Jealousy, I supposed. Or maybe just loneliness.

The third song was my favorite—a slow, romantic ballad about summer love and moonlight kisses. Peter's voice dropped lower, more intimate, and he gripped the microphone like he was telling secrets. I felt my face grow warm. When he sang the line about "the girl I dream about," his gaze swept across the audience, and for just a fraction of a second, I let myself believe he was looking at me.

He wasn't, of course. He was looking at all of us and none of us, creating the illusion of intimacy that made every girl feel special. But knowing that didn't stop my foolish heart from racing.

The song ended. The crowd applauded, and Peter took a small bow.

"Thank you, Bayshore! We'll be back tomorrow night, same time, same place. Don't forget about us now." He flashed that devastating smile one more time, and the Bayside Boys filed down the bandstand steps.

Immediately, a swarm of admirers surrounded them. Girls asking for autographs, boys wanting to talk about music and cars, parents complimenting their performance. Peter was at the center of it all, gracious and charming, giving everyone a moment of his attention.

I stayed where I was, watching from my safe distance. What would I even say if I approached him? "I come to every performance and stare at you like a lovesick puppy"? No. Better to keep my distance and preserve the dream.

The crowd began to disperse as the lights along the boardwalk blinked on, one string at a time. The Bayside Boys packed up their few props—the microphone, the record player, some promotional flyers about their weekend performances. Peter laughed at something Tommy said, clapping him on the shoulder. The bass singer stood apart, coiling a cable with methodical precision.

I should go home. Mama would have dinner waiting, and I'd promised to help her with the Henderson arrangement tonight. But I lingered, watching until the four of them walked off together toward the parking area where the performers kept their cars and motorcycles.

Only when they disappeared from view did I finally turn and start the walk home.

The boardwalk was quieter now, most people already at dinner or the early movie showing at the Strand. My footsteps echoed softly, and I hummed the melody of the romantic ballad under my breath, imagining different endings to my evening. Ones where Peter noticed me in the crowd. Where he asked my name. Where he smiled at me the way he smiled at everyone else, but somehow it meant more.

"When the sun goes down on the boardwalk, baby," I sang quietly, the words floating away on the ocean breeze. "That's when my heart starts calling for you..."

Tomorrow night, I'd be back. Same spot, same time. Watching from the safe shadows while Peter Castellano shone in the spotlight. Maybe tomorrow would be different. Maybe tomorrow he'd see me.

But probably not.

And still, I'd come back. Because these fifteen minutes of music and impossible dreams were the most alive I felt all day. Because summer in Bayshore was supposed to be magical, and if I couldn't have the magic, at least I could watch it from a distance.

I turned down the quieter end of the boardwalk where Foster's Flowers sat dark and locked. Our apartment was above the shop, and light glowed warm in the kitchen window. Mama would be setting the table, probably humming herself as she worked. She'd ask about my walk, and I'd say it was nice. She wouldn't push. She understood about dreams, even impossible ones.

Tomorrow I'd wake up and arrange flowers and count change and smile at customers. And when six o'clock came, I'd lock the door and walk to the bandstand and watch Peter Castellano sing love songs to a crowd of swooning girls.

It was enough. It had to be enough.

Even if some small part of me whispered that watching life happen wasn't the same as living it.

I pushed that thought away and climbed the stairs to our apartment, already counting the hours until tomorrow night's performance.
