# Chapter 16: Peter Finally Notices

The Saturday afternoon performance drew a decent crowd despite the heat. I stood in my usual spot, fanning myself with a folded performance flyer, watching the Bayside Boys work through their set. My mind kept wandering to tomorrow's Romano family dinner—what to wear, what to say, whether Nick's nonna would approve of me.

When the final song ended and the crowd began to disperse, I turned to leave. I needed to stop by Moretti's Bakery before it closed, pick up those cannoli Nick had recommended.

"Diane! Wait up!"

I turned to find Peter Castellano jogging toward me, his smile bright and charming as always. My stomach did a strange flip—not the flutter I used to get, but something closer to anxiety.

"Hey, Peter." I managed a smile.

"I'm glad I caught you." He fell into step beside me as we moved away from the bandstand. "I've been noticing you coming to all our shows. You're like our most dedicated fan."

"I like the music." The words felt automatic, rehearsed from weeks of defending my nightly attendance to Sally.

"We appreciate that. And I heard from the guys that you've got a really nice voice. From the audition, you know?" He flashed that practiced smile. "I wanted to ask—are you free tomorrow night? Maybe grab some food at the Seaside Diner? Just the two of us?"

The world tilted slightly. This was it. The moment I'd been imagining all summer. Peter Castellano was asking me out. Actually asking me out.

So why did I feel more nervous than excited?

"Tomorrow night?" I repeated, buying time while my brain caught up.

"Yeah. I could pick you up around seven?" He said it casually, like asking me out was no big deal. Maybe for him it wasn't. "What do you say?"

I should say yes. This was what I wanted. What I'd spent weeks dreaming about, planning for, hoping would happen.

"Okay," I heard myself say. "Yes. Tomorrow at seven."

Peter's smile widened. "Great! I'll pick you up at Foster's Flowers. See you then, Diane."

He walked back toward the bandstand where the other Bayside Boys were packing up equipment. I stood frozen on the boardwalk, my heart racing but not with joy. With something that felt uncomfortably like dread.

I forced my feet to move, heading toward Moretti's Bakery in a daze. Peter had asked me out. I should be floating, giddy, ecstatic.

Instead, I felt like I'd just made a terrible mistake.

At the bakery, I ordered a dozen cannoli like Nick had suggested, watching the baker box them carefully with white string. Peter's invitation replayed in my head. Just the two of us. The Seaside Diner. Tomorrow night.

Tomorrow night, when I was supposed to be at Nick's house meeting his family.

My stomach dropped. The Romano family dinner. I'd completely forgotten in the shock of Peter's invitation.

No—I hadn't forgotten. I'd said yes to Peter before my brain could remind me I already had plans. Important plans. Plans with Nick.

I paid for the cannoli and stepped back onto the boardwalk, my mind spinning. I'd have to cancel on Nick. Tell him something came up. He'd understand, wouldn't he? This was Peter Castellano asking me out. Anyone would understand choosing a date with Peter.

Except even as I thought it, the justification felt hollow.

I walked home slowly, the cannoli box swinging from my hand. The evening performance would start in an hour. Nick would be there, expecting to walk me home after. Expecting to talk about tomorrow's dinner with his family.

I'd have to tell him I couldn't come.

At home, I set the cannoli on the kitchen counter and retreated to my bedroom before Mama could ask questions I wasn't ready to answer. I stood at my window watching tourists stream toward the boardwalk for the evening show.

Why wasn't I happy? This was everything I'd wanted. The handsome lead singer had finally noticed me, had asked me out on an actual date. Girls would kill to be in my position.

But all I could think about was Nick's face when I'd have to tell him I was canceling our plans. The hurt I'd see there, quickly hidden behind polite understanding.

A knock on my door interrupted my spiral.

"Diane? Can I come in?"

"Yeah, Mama."

She entered carrying a cup of tea and sat on the edge of my bed. "You've been quiet since you came home. Everything alright?"

"Peter asked me out." I said it flatly, without inflection.

Mama's eyebrows rose. "Peter. The lead singer."

"Tomorrow night. Dinner at the Seaside Diner."

"I see." She studied my face. "And you said yes?"

"I did."

"But you don't seem happy about it."

I sank onto the bed beside her. "I should be happy. I've been watching him all summer, hoping he'd notice me. And now he has. This is what I wanted."

"Wanted past tense?" Mama's voice was gentle. "Or want present tense?"

"I don't know anymore." The admission felt like defeat. "I said yes before I thought about it. Before I remembered—" I stopped.

"Remembered what?"

"Nick invited me to Sunday dinner with his family tomorrow. To meet them properly." I twisted my hands together. "I forgot. Or didn't forget exactly, I just—Peter asked and I said yes without thinking."

Mama was quiet for a moment. "So you have two invitations for tomorrow evening."

"I can't do both."

"No, you can't." She set down her teacup. "Which one do you actually want to go to, honey?"

The question landed like a stone. I opened my mouth to say Peter's date—that's what I should want, right? But the words wouldn't come.

"I don't know," I whispered.

"I think you do know. You're just scared to admit it." Mama squeezed my hand. "The heart wants what it wants, Diane. Not what you think it should want. What it actually wants."

She left me alone with that thought and a cooling cup of tea I didn't drink.

At six-thirty, I forced myself to get ready for the evening performance. I needed to tell Nick in person. Couldn't avoid it, couldn't pretend it wasn't happening.

The boardwalk was crowded with the usual Saturday night energy. I found my spot and waited, my stomach churning with anxiety.

The Bayside Boys took the stage right on time. Peter looked confident and relaxed, working the crowd with his usual charm. I barely registered him. My eyes went straight to Nick at the back, serious and steady in his position.

The performance passed in a blur. When the final song ended and people began dispersing, I stayed rooted to my spot, waiting. Nick would come find me like he always did, ready for our evening walk.

He appeared at my elbow right on schedule. "Ready to—" He stopped, seeing my expression. "What's wrong?"

"Can we walk? I need to talk to you."

Concern flickered across his face, but he nodded. We started down the boardwalk in silence, the space between us feeling charged and uncomfortable.

"About tomorrow," I began, then faltered. How did I say this? "Something came up. I can't make dinner with your family."

Nick's steps slowed slightly. "Oh. Okay." His voice was carefully neutral. "Is everything alright?"

"Peter asked me out. To the Seaside Diner tomorrow night." The words tumbled out too fast. "He just—after the afternoon show today he asked, and I said yes before I thought about it. Before I remembered your family dinner."

The silence that followed felt endless. We kept walking, but Nick had created subtle distance between us, his hands in his pockets instead of reaching for mine like he'd been doing lately.

"I understand," he said finally. "Peter's... that's great, Diane. Really."

But it didn't sound great. It sounded like someone trying very hard to say the right thing.

"I'm sorry," I said quietly. "I should have remembered. Should have told Peter I already had plans."

"No, it's fine. It's Peter Castellano. Of course you said yes." There was no bitterness in his tone, just resignation. "My family will understand. We can do dinner another time. Maybe after Labor Day, if you're still..." He trailed off.

If I'm still interested, I finished mentally. If this thing between us still matters after summer ends.

We'd reached Foster's Flowers. Usually this was where we'd linger, talking for a few extra minutes before saying goodnight. Tonight, Nick stopped several feet from the door, maintaining distance.

"I hope you have fun tomorrow," he said. "Peter's a lucky guy."

"Nick—"

"I should get back. Equipment to pack up. I'll see you around, Diane."

He walked away before I could find the words to explain what I didn't understand myself. I watched him disappear into the boardwalk crowd, and the ache in my chest felt wrong for someone who'd just gotten asked out by the boy she'd been crushing on all summer.

Inside, Mama looked up from her book. "How did Nick take it?"

"He said he understood." I sank onto the couch. "He was nice about it. Polite."

"But?"

"But I hurt him. I could see it even though he was trying to hide it." Tears pricked my eyes. "Mama, why do I feel terrible? I should be excited about Peter. Instead I feel like I just made the worst decision of my life."

She pulled me close, letting me cry on her shoulder like I hadn't since I was small.

"Tomorrow you'll go on your date with Peter," she said softly. "And then you'll know what you actually want. Sometimes we need to get what we think we want before we understand what we really need."

I fell asleep that night still wearing my boardwalk clothes, too tired and confused to change. My last thought before sleep was of Nick's carefully neutral expression when I'd told him about Peter.

The look of someone who'd just lost something important but was too kind to say so.
