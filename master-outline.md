# MASTER OUTLINE: Sunset Serenade

## Chapter 1: The Summer Routine

Diane Foster closes Foster's Flowers at six o'clock on a warm July evening in 1957 and heads to the Bayshore boardwalk for her nightly ritual. She's spent every evening this summer watching the Bayside Boys perform at the central bandstand. The doo-wop group has become the summer's main attraction, drawing crowds of swooning girls and curious tourists. Diane positions herself in her usual spot near the front, close enough to see but not close enough to be noticed. She watches Peter Castellano, the handsome lead singer with the smooth voice and charming smile, and dreams about what it would be like if he noticed her in the crowd. The group performs three songs, their harmonies perfect under the setting sun. Diane notices Peter winking at different girls throughout the performance. When the show ends, she walks home alone, humming their closing song, already looking forward to tomorrow night's performance.

## Chapter 2: The Crush Deepens

At the flower shop the next morning, Diane's best friend Sally stops by on her break from the arcade. Sally teases Diane about her "hopeless Peter obsession" and tries to convince her to actually talk to him instead of just watching from the crowd. Diane insists that Peter doesn't even know she exists—she's just another face in the audience. That evening at the performance, Diane pays closer attention to Peter's stage presence. He's magnetic, effortlessly charming, and clearly aware of his effect on the crowd. When he sings the romantic ballad, Diane feels like he's singing directly to her, even though she knows he probably makes every girl feel that way. After the show, she watches him surrounded by admirers and Barbara Wellington, a confident summer visitor who always positions herself to get Peter's attention. Diane collects the performance flyer and adds it to her collection at home, feeling foolish but unable to stop.

## Chapter 3: The Bass Singer Notices

During the afternoon performance preparation, Nick Romano tunes his bass while watching the crowd gather early. He notices Diane setting up her usual spot, the girl who's been coming every single night all summer. Unlike the other girls who cluster around the stage shrieking for Peter, she actually seems to listen to the music. Nick mentions her to Tommy Morrison, the tenor singer, commenting that she's dedicated. Tommy laughs and says she's got it bad for Peter like everyone else. At that night's performance, Nick finds himself watching Diane's face during songs. She closes her eyes during harmonies and mouths the words she knows. When Peter hits his solo, her expression turns dreamy and distant. Nick thinks it's kind of sad—Peter's his best friend, but Nick knows Peter's got a casual girlfriend in the next town over and girls in three other boardwalk stops. The look on Diane's face suggests she thinks this means something.

## Chapter 4: The Competition Announcement

The Bayside Boys make a special announcement before their Friday night performance: they're hosting a singing competition next week where a girl from the audience will be chosen to perform a duet with the group. The winner gets to sing at Saturday's special end-of-summer show. The crowd erupts with excitement. Peter explains that interested girls should sign up at the bandstand, and they'll hold auditions. Diane's heart races—this is her chance to actually interact with Peter, to have him notice her. After the show, she nervously approaches the sign-up sheet. Sally encourages her, saying she has a beautiful voice even if she only sings to herself. Diane signs her name with shaking hands. Walking home, she's already imagining standing on stage next to Peter, his attention finally focused on her. She doesn't notice Nick watching her sign up, a thoughtful expression on his face.

## Chapter 5: Obsessive Preparation

Diane spends the next week in anxious preparation. She practices constantly—singing while arranging flowers at the shop, rehearsing in her bedroom, humming harmonies while walking the boardwalk. Her mother Helen notices the sudden intensity and gently asks if Diane is okay. Diane explains about the competition, and Helen encourages her but warns her not to put all her hopes on one moment. Sally helps Diane pick out an outfit for the audition: a soft blue dress that brings out her eyes. Diane attends every Bayside Boys performance leading up to auditions, studying Peter's technique, memorizing his gestures, dreaming about their duet. She barely sleeps the night before auditions. At the shop that morning, she's distracted and anxious. When evening comes, she changes into her blue dress, checks her appearance a dozen times, and heads to the bandstand with her stomach in knots, ready to finally step out of the shadows.

## Chapter 6: Stage Fright Strikes

Twelve girls audition for the duet spot. Diane watches them go one by one, each singing with varying degrees of confidence. Barbara Wellington performs with polished self-assurance. When Diane's name is called, she walks on stage feeling like her legs might give out. Peter stands at the microphone with his characteristic smile, welcoming her. The other Bayside Boys wait behind him—Tommy, Joey, and Nick positioned in their usual formation. Peter asks what song she'd like to sing, and Diane's voice comes out as barely a whisper. The crowd seems enormous suddenly. Her mouth goes dry, her hands shake, and when the music starts, she can't make herself sing. Peter doesn't notice her panic—he's already moving into the song himself, expecting her to join in. Diane stands frozen, humiliated, wanting to run. Just as she's about to flee the stage, a deep voice joins Peter's lead, harmonizing underneath, steady and grounding.

## Chapter 7: Nick Steps Forward

Nick Romano steps forward from his position at the back, his bass voice creating a foundation that wraps around Peter's lead. He positions himself next to Diane, not looking at her but singing steady and sure, giving her something solid to hold onto. His presence is calm, undemanding. Diane takes a shaky breath and joins in quietly at first, then stronger as Nick's bass voice guides her. Their voices blend unexpectedly well—her clear soprano against his deep bass creates an interesting texture that Peter's lead floats over. The harmonies lock together, and Diane stops thinking about the crowd, focusing only on following Nick's steady rhythm. When the song ends, the audience applauds enthusiastically. Peter claps Nick on the shoulder, thanking him for "saving the audition." The other Bayside Boys nod approvingly. Nick finally looks at Diane and gives her a small, genuine smile. She manages to thank him before hurrying off stage, her heart still racing but for a different reason now.

## Chapter 8: Unexpected Chemistry

The Bayside Boys deliberate and announce that Diane and Nick's duet won—not for Diane's solo performance, but for the unexpected chemistry they created together. Diane will perform with the full group at Saturday's show, but her featured duet will be with Nick, not Peter. The crowd congratulates her, and Barbara looks annoyed. Peter is gracious, telling Diane she'll do great. But most of the congratulations go to Peter anyway, girls clustering around him to discuss the upcoming show. Nick hangs back as usual, and when the crowd thins, Diane approaches him to thank him properly. He shrugs it off casually, saying he just didn't want her to have to run off embarrassed. They stand awkwardly for a moment before Nick offers to walk her home since it's late. Diane accepts, surprised by the offer. As they walk along the boardwalk, Diane realizes this is the first real conversation she's ever had with anyone from the group.

## Chapter 9: The First Real Conversation

Nick and Diane walk slowly toward Foster's Flowers as the boardwalk empties behind them. Nick asks about her work at the flower shop, and Diane finds herself talking more freely than she expected. He's easy to talk to—he actually listens and asks follow-up questions instead of waiting for his turn to speak. When she asks about him, Nick explains he works part-time at The Melody Box record shop and is saving for college. He wants to study music composition. Diane is surprised—she assumed all the Bayside Boys were just having fun for the summer, not taking music seriously. Nick talks about different vocal arrangements, about how bass lines work, and Diane realizes he understands music on a level she's only dreamed about. When they reach the flower shop, her mother is closing up. Helen meets Nick and clearly approves of him. After Nick says goodnight and walks away, Helen comments that he seems like a genuine young man. Diane agrees but feels oddly confused.

## Chapter 10: Unexpected Ease

The next evening, Diane arrives at the boardwalk earlier than usual, still processing the previous night's conversation with Nick. During the performance, she finds herself listening differently—picking out Nick's bass line beneath Peter's lead, hearing how Nick's voice creates the foundation that makes everything else work. After the show, Nick appears next to her and casually asks if she wants to walk again. They fall into easy conversation about music, about the summer, about small things that feel significant in the telling. Nick makes her laugh with stories about the Bayside Boys' early practice sessions when they couldn't stay on key. When Diane mentions she loves music but doesn't understand it the way he does, Nick offers to teach her. Over the next few evenings, walking home from performances becomes their routine. Sally notices and makes knowing comments. Diane insists they're just friends, that she still likes Peter, but she realizes she looks forward to these walks more than the actual performances. She's surprised by how easy talking to Nick feels, how natural.

## Chapter 11: The Walks Become Routine

Walking home together after performances becomes an unspoken arrangement between Diane and Nick. He's always there waiting after the show ends, and Diane finds herself looking for him in the crowd during performances. They talk about everything—her father's death four years ago, his large family and how being the middle child taught him to listen more than speak, their shared love of music that goes deeper than just listening. Nick doesn't try to impress her or perform for her the way Peter performs for everyone. When they reach her house each night, they linger on the sidewalk a few extra minutes, neither quite ready to end the conversation. Sally observes that Diane talks about Nick more than Peter lately, but Diane insists Peter is still the one she likes—Nick is just a friend. Helen comments that Nick seems to find excuses to walk past the flower shop during the day. Diane notices but doesn't let herself think too hard about what it means.

## Chapter 12: The Melody Box

Nick invites Diane to visit him at The Melody Box on her afternoon off. The record shop is tucked between two larger stores, easy to miss if you're not looking for it. Inside, it's a treasure trove of albums and 45s, with listening booths along one wall. Mr. Gennaro, the elderly owner, greets Diane warmly and tells her Nick has excellent taste in music. Nick leads her to the jazz section in back and plays her recordings she's never heard before—Ella Fitzgerald, Miles Davis, Billie Holiday. He explains chord progressions and harmonic structures, making complex theory accessible and exciting. Diane absorbs everything, fascinated not just by the music but by the way Nick's face lights up when he talks about it. He teaches her to hear the spaces between notes, the way silence can be as important as sound. They spend hours in the shop, and when Diane finally leaves, Nick gives her a record to borrow. Walking home, she realizes she forgot to attend that evening's Bayside Boys performance—the first one she's missed all summer.

## Chapter 13: The Songwriter Revealed

During their next walk home, Diane asks Nick about the original songs the Bayside Boys perform. Nick admits, somewhat embarrassed, that he writes most of them—the melodies, the arrangements, the harmonies. Peter writes some lyrics and comes up with basic ideas, but Nick shapes everything into actual songs. Diane is stunned. She's been watching Peter perform these songs, crediting him with their beauty, when Nick created them. She asks why Nick doesn't get credit, and he shrugs—Peter's the lead singer, it's his group technically, and Nick doesn't need recognition. He just loves making the music. Diane argues that he should be acknowledged for his work, but Nick says he's content being the foundation. That night, Diane attends the performance and listens completely differently. She hears Nick's fingerprints all over the arrangements, sees how he guides the other singers with tiny cues, watches him shape the sound from his position in back. She feels foolish for never noticing before.

## Chapter 14: Hearing Differently

Diane begins truly hearing the Bayside Boys' music for the first time. She recognizes that Peter's lead voice is beautiful, but it's Nick's bass line that gives the songs their emotional weight and structural integrity. During one performance, Peter's voice cracks slightly on a high note, but Nick smoothly adjusts the bass harmony to cover it, making the mistake invisible. Diane sees how often this happens—Nick constantly supporting, correcting, enhancing, always from the background. She watches the girls in the crowd screaming for Peter and realizes she used to be one of them, seeing only the surface shine. After the show, she tells Nick what she observed, and he seems surprised that she noticed. He explains that's what bass singers do—they're the foundation everyone else builds on. Diane says it seems lonely, always supporting but never supported. Nick says he doesn't mind, but something in his expression suggests maybe he does, a little.

## Chapter 15: Confusion Sets In

Diane sits in Foster's Flowers arranging a wedding bouquet, her mind wandering to Nick explaining harmonic progressions, Nick's steady presence on stage during her audition, Nick's easy laugh during their walks. She catches herself and feels guilty—she's supposed to be focused on Peter. That evening at the performance, she deliberately positions herself where Peter will see her, trying to recapture that original flutter of attraction. Peter looks handsome as always, his smile bright and practiced. But when Diane listens to him sing, she finds herself distracted by Nick's voice underneath, searching for that bass line. After the show, both Peter and Nick approach her. Peter compliments her dress casually before being pulled away by fans. Nick asks if she wants to walk, and Diane says yes without hesitation. Walking home, Nick is quieter than usual, and Diane wonders if he senses her confusion. She realizes she's been looking forward to seeing Nick more than Peter lately, but she doesn't know what that means or if she's ready to examine it.

## Chapter 16: Peter Finally Notices

Peter Castellano catches Diane after a Saturday afternoon performance. He's noticed her coming to every show, and he's heard she has a pretty voice from the audition. He asks if she'd like to go to the Seaside Diner with him tomorrow night—just the two of them. Diane's heart should be soaring, but instead she feels strangely anxious. This is what she wanted all summer. She says yes. Peter flashes his charming smile and says he'll pick her up at seven. Walking home alone—Nick had to stay behind for equipment breakdown—Diane tells herself this is perfect. She got what she wanted. That evening, she tells Sally about the date, and Sally reacts with less enthusiasm than expected, asking what happened to Nick. Diane insists Nick is just a friend. Sally looks skeptical but wishes her luck. Diane spends Sunday preparing for the date, trying on different outfits, styling her hair. Helen notices her daughter seems more nervous than excited. When Peter arrives that evening in his father's Chevy, Diane ignores the small voice wondering what Nick is doing tonight.

## Chapter 17: The Disappointing Date

Peter takes Diane to the Seaside Diner, the most popular teen spot in Bayshore. He's charming and attentive, holding the door, pulling out her chair, ordering for both of them without asking what she wants. The booth is conspicuous, and other diners notice them together. Peter seems aware of being watched and plays to it slightly. Their conversation stays surface-level—Peter talks about the Bayside Boys' success this summer, about girls who've asked for his autograph, about his plans to maybe take the group professional. When Diane tries to discuss the actual music or ask about his creative process, he deflects with jokes. He mentions Nick writes "most of the boring technical stuff" but Peter brings the songs to life. Diane bristles but doesn't argue. Peter asks almost nothing about her—her work, her interests, her father, her dreams. When he leans in to hold her hand across the table, it feels performative, like he's playing the role of boyfriend rather than being genuinely interested. Diane realizes with sinking disappointment that there's nothing beneath the surface charm.

## Chapter 18: The Empty Feeling

Peter drives Diane home after the date, talking mostly about himself the entire way. He walks her to the door and kisses her cheek, saying they should do this again. Diane says goodnight and goes inside, expecting to feel elated but instead feeling hollow. Helen asks how it went, and Diane says it was fine, but her mother sees through her. That night, Diane lies in bed replaying the evening and comparing it involuntarily to her walks with Nick—how Nick asks questions and remembers her answers, how conversation flows naturally, how comfortable silence feels between them. With Peter, she felt like an audience member even on a date. The next evening at the boardwalk, Diane watches the performance feeling detached. Peter winks at her during a song, and she realizes it's the same wink he gives every girl. After the show, Nick approaches to ask about walking home, but Diane makes an excuse about being tired. She sees hurt flash across his face before he nods and steps back. Walking home alone, she misses him immediately.

## Chapter 19: Nick Pulls Away

Over the next few days, Nick becomes politely distant. He still performs with the Bayside Boys, but he doesn't seek out Diane after shows anymore. When they do interact, he's friendly but reserved, creating space between them that wasn't there before. Tommy mentions to Sally that Nick has been quiet lately, not himself. Diane tells herself this is what she wanted—she went on a date with Peter, so obviously Nick is respecting that. But she feels the loss of their conversations, their easy companionship. She sees Nick at The Melody Box through the window one afternoon and almost goes in, but stops herself. Peter asks her to another movie at the drive-in, and Diane agrees, trying to convince herself she just needs to give him more of a chance. That evening's performance, Diane watches Nick instead of Peter and sees sadness in his expression when he thinks no one is looking. After the show, Peter takes her hand to walk her to his car, and Diane glances back to see Nick watching before deliberately turning away.

## Chapter 20: The Realization Begins

The drive-in date with Peter is a repeat of the diner—surface charm, one-sided conversation, performative romance. When he tries to kiss her more seriously, Diane pulls back instinctively, claiming she's not ready. Peter is gracious about it, but Diane senses his interest cooling. Driving home, she realizes she doesn't care. She doesn't want Peter's attention anymore, hasn't wanted it for a while if she's honest with herself. The next day at Foster's Flowers, Sally confronts her directly: Diane has been miserable since she started dating Peter and hasn't been herself since she stopped talking to Nick. Sally says Nick is clearly heartbroken, and Diane needs to figure out what she actually wants. That evening, Diane stands at the boardwalk during the performance and admits to herself what she's been avoiding: she doesn't hear Peter's voice anymore. She only hears Nick's—the steady bass line that's been there all along, holding everything together, the voice that actually moves her. She's been looking at the wrong person all summer. The realization both thrills and terrifies her.

## Chapter 21: The Final Performance Approaches

The Bayside Boys announce that Saturday's show will be their final performance of the summer—a special extended concert ending with Diane's featured duet with Nick. Labor Day weekend approaches, tourists prepare to leave, and summer's end brings melancholy to Bayshore. Peter assumes Diane will be watching from her usual spot, his date essentially. Nick has resigned himself to performing the duet professionally then stepping back, giving Diane space to be with Peter if that's what she wants. Diane rehearses the duet alone at home, but her heart isn't in it. She realizes she's been hiding all summer—hiding behind her crush on Peter, hiding from genuine connection because fantasy is safer than risk. Sally tells her that if she doesn't tell Nick how she feels, she'll regret it forever. Helen agrees, reminding Diane that her father always said the things you don't do are what you regret most. Diane knows they're right but doesn't know how to fix what she's broken. She's avoided Nick for two weeks, and now the summer is ending.

## Chapter 22: Confronting the Truth

The day before the final performance, Diane works at Foster's Flowers trying to sort through her feelings. She thinks about the entire summer—starting with fantasy and ending with real connection she almost lost by refusing to see what was right in front of her. She thinks about Nick stepping forward during her audition, his patient teaching, his genuine interest in who she actually is, the way music sounds different when she understands the foundation beneath it. She realizes she fell in love with Nick while she was busy pretending to love Peter, and she's been too afraid to admit it because loving Nick means being truly seen, truly known, which is terrifying in a way fantasy never was. That evening, she goes to the boardwalk for the second-to-last performance. She doesn't watch Peter at all—she watches Nick, trying to will him to look at her, but he keeps his eyes carefully away. After the show, she tries to approach him, but Barbara Wellington intercepts her, mentioning smugly that Peter is losing interest since Diane is "such a cold fish." Diane barely hears her, pushing past to find Nick, but he's already gone.

## Chapter 23: The Final Performance Night

Saturday evening arrives with perfect beach weather—warm breeze, clear sky, the sunset promising to be spectacular. The boardwalk is packed for the Bayside Boys' final show of 1957. Diane arrives early, her stomach in knots. She wears the blue dress from her audition, hoping Nick will remember. The Bayside Boys take the stage to huge applause, opening with their most popular song. Peter is in peak form, working the crowd, soaking in the adulation. But Diane only watches Nick, who stands in his usual position looking more reserved than she's ever seen him. The group performs their full repertoire—upbeat numbers, romantic ballads, crowd favorites. Between songs, Peter thanks everyone for an amazing summer. He specifically thanks Nick for the musical arrangements, and Nick nods but doesn't smile. The concert builds toward the final segment: Diane's featured duet. Peter announces her, and the crowd applauds. Diane walks onto the stage with her heart pounding, but not from stage fright this time.

## Chapter 24: Performing Together Again

Diane takes her position next to Nick on stage for the first time since the audition. He glances at her briefly, his expression unreadable, then focuses on the music. The opening notes play, and Nick begins the bass line—steady, sure, beautiful. Diane joins him, and their voices blend the way they did before, maybe even better now. As they sing, Diane stops performing for the crowd and sings to Nick, trying to communicate through the music what she doesn't know how to say in words. She sees the moment he realizes she's not singing to the audience—his eyes meet hers, surprised and questioning. The harmonies build, wrapping around each other, and something shifts between them, an understanding passing through the song itself. When the final note fades, the crowd erupts in applause, but Diane and Nick stand frozen, looking at each other, the rest of the world temporarily forgotten. Peter joins them, clapping Nick on the back, breaking the moment. Diane knows she needs to talk to Nick before the night ends, before summer ends and this chance disappears forever.

## Chapter 25: Searching for Nick

The Bayside Boys finish their concert with a rousing final number, the crowd singing along, the perfect ending to a perfect summer. As the applause fades and the audience begins to disperse, Diane tries to find Nick, but he's swept up in the post-show chaos—equipment breakdown, fans wanting autographs, Mr. Gennaro presenting the boys with thank-you gifts. Peter appears next to Diane, assuming she's waiting for him, and talks about what a great show it was. Diane barely listens, scanning the crowd for Nick. Barbara tries to claim Peter's attention. Sally appears and physically steers Diane away from the crowd, telling her that Nick went backstage. The backstage area is behind the bandstand, a small space where the boys store equipment and change. Diane hesitates—she's never been back there before, it feels like crossing a line. Sally pushes her forward encouragingly. Diane takes a breath and walks around to the back of the bandstand, her heart racing, knowing exactly what she needs to say if she can find the courage.

## Chapter 26: Backstage Confession

Diane finds Nick alone backstage, coiling cables and packing equipment with methodical focus. He looks up when she enters, surprise and caution in his expression. She asks if they can talk, and he nods, setting down the cables. Diane doesn't know how to begin, so she just speaks from her heart—she's sorry for the past two weeks, sorry for being blind all summer, sorry for not seeing what was right in front of her. She tells him she was chasing a fantasy with Peter because fantasy is safe and doesn't require real vulnerability. But Nick made her want to be brave, made her want to be truly seen. She tells him she's been listening to the wrong voice all summer. She was so focused on Peter's lead that she missed the bass line holding everything together—the foundation, the part that actually moved her. Nick listens without interrupting, his expression carefully neutral until she finishes. Then he asks quietly if she means it, if she's sure, because he can't be a second choice. Diane says he was never second—he was the choice she was too scared to make until now.

## Chapter 27: The Kiss

Nick studies Diane's face for a long moment, searching for certainty, and whatever he sees there convinces him. He steps closer and tells her he's been falling for her since the first time he saw her actually listening to the music instead of just watching the performance. He thought he didn't have a chance because he's not Peter—not flashy or charming or the one everyone wants. But he couldn't stop himself from walking her home, from sharing music with her, from hoping she might see him the way he sees her. Diane reaches for his hand and says she does see him, finally, clearly. She sees the person who stepped forward when she was frozen with fear, who taught her to hear music differently, who knows her better after a few weeks than Peter did after a summer. Nick smiles, the first real smile she's seen from him in two weeks, and asks if he can kiss her. Diane says yes. Their first kiss is gentle, tentative, then deeper as weeks of held-back feeling pour into it. It feels completely different from anything with Peter—real, vulnerable, right.

## Chapter 28: Nick's Dedication

The boardwalk is still crowded when Nick and Diane emerge from backstage hand in hand. Tommy sees them first and elbows Joey, both grinning widely. Sally squeals and hugs Diane. Helen, who came to watch the final performance, beams with approval. Peter notices and looks momentarily surprised, then shrugs good-naturedly and tells Nick he's a lucky guy. Nick says he knows. The Bayside Boys have one final tradition—an encore song performed from the boardwalk rail as the crowd disperses, informal and intimate. The four boys gather, and before they begin, Nick does something he's never done before: he steps forward to the front and asks for the microphone. Peter hands it over, surprised but supportive. Nick looks directly at Diane and tells the remaining crowd that this last song is a dedication—for the girl who taught him that sometimes you have to step out of the background to get what matters most. Diane's eyes fill with tears. The Bayside Boys launch into a romantic ballad, but this time Nick's bass voice carries the lead melody for the first verse before the others join in harmony.

## Chapter 29: The Last Song of Summer

Nick's dedication transforms the final song into something magical. The crowd that remained grows quiet, sensing they're witnessing something special and genuine. Nick sings with his eyes on Diane, his deep voice carrying emotion that no amount of Peter's charm could match. When the other Bayside Boys join in harmony, they follow Nick's lead for once, supporting his voice instead of Peter's. The arrangement is beautiful—Nick's creative genius on full display now that he's allowed himself to step into the spotlight. Diane watches him with pride and wonder, seeing him fully for the first time: not just the quiet bass singer, but a complete person—talented, brave, and finally, hers. The song builds to a gentle ending, the harmonies fading like the summer itself. The remaining crowd applauds warmly. The Bayside Boys take their final bow. Nick comes straight to Diane, and she kisses him again, not caring who sees. Summer is ending, but something better is beginning.

## Chapter 30: The Foundation That Holds

The boardwalk empties as the Bayside Boys pack up for the last time. Peter talks about maybe reforming the group next summer. Tommy and Joey discuss college plans. Nick and Diane walk along the beach as the sun sets, their hands intertwined, talking about the future. Nick will attend music college in the spring but will be in Bayshore through fall and winter. Diane will keep working at Foster's Flowers and finish her junior year, but now she's thinking about music too—maybe voice lessons, maybe learning theory from Nick. They talk about writing songs together, about how the best music comes from strong foundations. Nick says he's glad he stepped forward during her audition, even though he thought she wanted Peter. Diane says she's glad he did too, because otherwise she might have spent her whole life chasing fantasies instead of recognizing real love. They kiss as the last light fades from the sky, the sound of waves providing the bass line to their own perfect ending. The summer taught Diane to hear differently, to see beyond surface shine, and to recognize that the best person isn't always the one in the spotlight—sometimes it's the one holding everything together from the background. And Nick learned that stepping into his own spotlight doesn't mean losing who he is. Together, they've found their harmony.
