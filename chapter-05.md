# Chapter 5: Obsessive Preparation

The week between signing up and auditions passed in a blur of nervous energy and constant rehearsal. I practiced everywhere—humming harmonies while arranging bouquets at Foster's Flowers, singing full voice in my bedroom with the door closed, running through scales while walking to the boardwalk.

"Someone's been bit by the music bug," Mrs. Patterson said on Tuesday morning as I wrapped her gladiolus stems. I'd been absently harmonizing with the radio playing in the back room.

I felt my cheeks warm. "Sorry, I didn't realize I was singing out loud."

"Don't apologize, dear. You have a lovely voice. Are you performing somewhere?"

"Maybe," I said, which felt safer than explaining the whole situation.

After Mrs. Patterson left, I caught my reflection in the shop window and barely recognized the girl staring back. My expression was different—anxious but alive, like someone who'd finally decided to step out of the shadows.

"You're going to wear yourself out," Mama said that afternoon, finding me in the back room practicing vocal exercises while restocking ribbon.

"I need to be ready."

"You're already ready. You've been singing beautifully your whole life." She set down the arrangement she was carrying and studied me with concern. "Diane, honey, this is supposed to be fun. You look like you're preparing for battle."

"It feels like battle," I admitted. "Have you seen some of the other girls who signed up? Barbara Wellington has probably been taking voice lessons since she was five."

"So you'll do your best and see what happens. That's all anyone can ask." Mama squeezed my shoulder gently. "Don't pin all your hopes on one moment. That's too much pressure for any person to carry."

I knew she was right, but I couldn't help myself. This audition had taken over my thoughts, pushing out everything else. At night I dreamed about standing on the bandstand, about Peter's smile turned in my direction, about finally being seen instead of invisible.

Sally stopped by Wednesday afternoon with a mission.

"We're picking your outfit," she announced, flipping the shop sign to "Closed" despite it being only five o'clock.

"Sally, I can't close early. Mama needs—"

"Your mother sent me," Sally interrupted. "She said you need a break and some perspective. So we're going through your closet and finding something that makes you feel confident."

An hour later, my bedroom looked like a textile explosion. Skirts and blouses covered every surface, and I'd tried on at least a dozen combinations while Sally played fashion critic.

"Too formal."

"Too casual."

"That color washes you out."

Finally, she held up a soft blue dress—the same one I'd worn on the Fourth of July when I'd first seen the Bayside Boys perform. "This. This is the one."

I took it from her, running my fingers over the cotton fabric. "You don't think it's too simple?"

"It's perfect. It brings out your eyes, the color is calming, and you look like yourself in it. Not like you're trying to be someone else." Sally flopped back on my bed, scattering rejected outfits. "Trust me on this."

I held the dress up to my chest and looked in the mirror. She was right—something about it felt right. Like wearing armor made of softness.

"Okay," I said. "The blue dress."

"Good. Now let's talk about your song choice. What are you singing?"

"I don't know yet." I'd been agonizing over this question for days. "Their romantic ballad is my favorite, but everyone's probably choosing that one. Maybe something upbeat would stand out more? But what if I can't hit the high notes when I'm nervous?"

"Breathe," Sally commanded. "Sit down and breathe."

I sat on the edge of the bed, forcing air into my lungs.

"What song makes you feel most like yourself?" Sally asked. "Not what you think Peter wants to hear. What do you connect with?"

I thought about it, really thought. "The ballad," I admitted. "It's the one that moves me. The one I know every word to, every harmony."

"Then that's what you sing. You'll do it better because you actually feel it."

That evening, I went to the boardwalk as usual. The Bayside Boys' performance had become the anchor of my day, but tonight I watched with different eyes. I studied how they moved, how they cued each other, how the harmonies fit together.

Nick stood in his usual position at the back, his deep bass voice providing the foundation. I found myself paying more attention to him than before—noticing how he watched the others, how he subtly guided the tempo with tiny gestures the audience couldn't see.

When they performed the romantic ballad, I closed my eyes and listened to the structure. Peter's melody on top, sweet and soaring. Tommy's tenor harmony weaving through the middle. Joey's support bridging the gap. And underneath it all, Nick's bass line holding everything together.

That's what I'd need to do—find my place in that structure, blend my voice without getting lost.

After the show, I didn't linger like usual. I went straight home and spent two hours in my room with the door closed, singing along to the radio and trying to imagine myself on that stage.

Thursday brought a new kind of anxiety. Auditions were tonight. By this time tomorrow, I'd either have won the competition or I'd be able to stop obsessing and return to my quiet, invisible life.

I wasn't sure which option scared me more.

"You're dropping petals," Mama pointed out midmorning, gesturing at the carnation stems I'd been supposed to be trimming.

I looked down and realized I'd mangled the poor flowers, my distracted hands working on autopilot while my mind ran through worst-case scenarios.

"Sorry," I mumbled, setting down the scissors before I could do more damage.

"Go take a walk," Mama said gently. "Get some fresh air. You're no good to me in this state anyway."

I didn't argue. I grabbed my cardigan and headed out onto the boardwalk, letting the salt air and morning sunshine work their calming magic.

The beach stretched out beside the boardwalk, dotted with early sunbathers and children building sandcastles. Gulls circled overhead, their cries mixing with the sound of waves. Everything felt normal and peaceful, the world completely unconcerned with my personal crisis.

I walked all the way to the end of the boardwalk and back, breathing deeply, trying to quiet my racing thoughts.

Tonight. It was really happening tonight.

Back at the shop, Mama took one look at my face and sent me upstairs to rest.

"You're exhausted and you're making yourself sick with worry. Go lie down for a few hours. I'll manage down here."

I didn't have the energy to protest. I climbed the stairs to our apartment and collapsed on my bed, certain I'd never be able to sleep.

But apparently anxiety was exhausting, because I woke three hours later to find the afternoon sun slanting through my window and Mama gently shaking my shoulder.

"It's five o'clock, honey. You should start getting ready."

I sat up, my heart immediately resuming its anxious pounding. Two hours until auditions.

I took my time bathing and styling my hair, using the rituals as meditation. Each pin I placed, each curl I set, was a small act of preparation. By the time I slipped into the blue dress, I almost felt ready.

Almost.

"You look beautiful," Mama said from my doorway.

I turned from the mirror, smoothing the skirt with nervous hands. "I look terrified."

"You look brave." She came into the room and took both my hands in hers. "Your father would be so proud of you right now. Not because you might win, but because you're trying. Because you're stepping forward instead of standing back."

My throat tightened with emotion. "What if I freeze up there?"

"Then you freeze, and you survive it, and you know you were brave enough to try. That's what matters."

I hugged her tight, breathing in her familiar scent of flowers and vanilla.

"Thank you," I whispered.

"Go show them what you've got, sweetheart."

I left the apartment at six-thirty, giving myself plenty of time to get to the bandstand. The evening was perfect—warm and clear, with that golden quality that made everything look magical.

The boardwalk was already crowded with people heading toward the bandstand. Apparently auditions were considered public entertainment.

My stomach clenched with fresh nerves. I'd known there would be an audience, but seeing the actual crowd made it real in a way I hadn't fully processed.

Sally was waiting for me near the cotton candy stand, wearing a huge grin.

"There she is! You look amazing, Di."

"I feel like I might throw up."

"That's normal. Come on, we need to check in."

She linked her arm through mine and pulled me toward the bandstand. A table had been set up with another clipboard—this one for the girls who'd signed up to confirm their participation and get their audition order.

Twelve names on the list. Twelve girls competing for one spot.

I signed next to my name with a shaking hand. My audition slot was number eight—right in the middle.

"Good position," Sally said. "Not so early you're at a disadvantage, not so late everyone's tired of listening."

I nodded numbly, not trusting my voice.

The crowd was gathering, filling in the space around the bandstand. I spotted familiar faces—girls from school, regular boardwalk visitors, curious tourists. And there at the front, Barbara Wellington in a yellow sundress, looking supremely confident.

The Bayside Boys emerged from behind the bandstand at exactly seven o'clock. Peter stepped to the microphone with his characteristic smile.

"Good evening, Bayshore! Welcome to our first-ever Bayside Boys singing competition!"

The crowd cheered. I pressed my hand against my churning stomach.

This was really happening.

"We've got twelve talented young ladies competing tonight," Peter continued. "They'll each sing one song with us, and at the end, we'll announce our winner. Let's give all our contestants a round of applause for their courage!"

More cheering. Sally squeezed my arm encouragingly.

"First up," Peter consulted his clipboard, "Miss Jennifer Walsh!"

A girl with auburn hair climbed the bandstand steps, and my week of preparation condensed into this single moment of truth.

I was really going to do this.
