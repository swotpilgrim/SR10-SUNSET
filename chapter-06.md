# Chapter 6: Stage Fright Strikes

Seven girls auditioned before me, and I watched every one with growing dread.

Jennifer Walsh forgot the lyrics halfway through. Marjorie Klein looked at her feet the entire time. Barbara Wellington performed with professional polish, hitting every note perfectly.

"She's good," Sally whispered beside me.

I couldn't respond. My throat had gone dry.

Each performance showed me how unprepared I was. These girls had confidence I'd never possess.

What had I been thinking?

"Number eight," Peter called, checking his clipboard. "Miss Diane Foster!"

The world tilted sideways. Sally gave me an encouraging push, and somehow my legs started moving, carrying me toward the bandstand steps even though every instinct screamed at me to run in the opposite direction.

The stairs felt impossibly steep. My heart hammered against my ribs so hard I thought everyone could hear it.

The Bayside Boys stood on stage—four young men in their performance whites, looking professional and at ease. Peter stood at the front, his smile welcoming. Tommy and Joey flanked him.

And at the back, Nick Romano watched me with those steady dark eyes.

The crowd stretched out before me like an ocean—hundreds of faces all watching.

I was going to die. Right here, right now.

"Welcome, Diane," Peter said, his voice smooth and practiced. "What song are you singing for us tonight?"

I opened my mouth to answer and nothing came out.

Peter waited, his smile never wavering. The crowd waited. The Bayside Boys waited.

My tongue felt thick and useless. The words were right there in my head—"the romantic ballad" or even just "the slow one"—but they wouldn't travel from my brain to my mouth.

"The... I..." My voice came out as barely a whisper, thin and shaking.

"The romantic ballad?" Peter prompted helpfully. "That's a popular choice tonight."

I managed a nod, not trusting myself to speak again.

"Great choice." Peter turned to the others. "Guys, you ready?"

Tommy and Joey moved into position. Nick stepped slightly forward from his back spot, his bass voice ready to provide the foundation.

The crowd seemed to grow larger with every passing second. Faces blurred together into one massive, watching entity. The lights felt too bright. The air too thin.

Peter counted us in. "One, two, three—"

The music started—their voices beginning the opening harmony without instrumental backing. It was the most exposed, vulnerable kind of performance, nothing to hide behind.

Peter's lead melody began, smooth and confident. He expected me to join in on the second line, my soprano harmony weaving above his lead.

I knew the words. I'd practiced this song a hundred times, could sing it in my sleep. But standing here under these lights, with all these eyes watching, my throat closed up completely.

Nothing came out.

Peter kept singing, his eyes flicking toward me with slight concern. He'd assumed I'd just needed an extra bar to find my courage. But the second line passed, and the third, and I still stood frozen, silent, useless.

The other Bayside Boys continued the harmony, professional enough to cover the gap I should have been filling. But it was obvious—glaringly, humiliatingly obvious—that something was wrong.

I couldn't breathe properly. The air came in short, sharp gasps that made my chest hurt. My hands were shaking so hard I clasped them together in front of my dress, trying to hold myself together through sheer physical force.

The crowd's eyes felt like physical weight pressing down on me. I could see pity on some faces, amusement on others. Barbara Wellington looked smug.

Peter was still singing, but I could see the question in his expression: Are you going to join in?

I wanted to. I wanted it desperately. But my voice was locked behind a wall of pure panic, and I couldn't break through.

This was my nightmare made real. Standing in front of everyone, exposed and failing, proving that I was exactly as unremarkable as I'd always feared.

I should run. I should turn around and flee down those stairs and keep running until I reached home, where I could hide in my room and never show my face in Bayshore again.

My feet started to shift, preparing to bolt.

And then a deep voice joined Peter's melody from behind me.

Nick's bass line entered the song, steady and grounding. But he wasn't singing from his usual position at the back. He'd stepped forward, and I felt rather than saw him move to stand beside me.

His presence was calming in a way I couldn't explain. Solid. Undemanding. Like an anchor in a storm.

He didn't look at me, didn't acknowledge my panic. He just sang, his deep voice wrapping around Peter's lead, creating a foundation so steady and sure that it felt like something I could hold onto.

I took a shaky breath.

Nick's bass line continued, patient and unwavering. The notes were simple, the rhythm clear. Something I could follow instead of lead.

My mouth opened, and a thin, wavering sound emerged. Barely a whisper, nowhere near the harmony line I'd practiced. But it was sound. It was something.

Nick adjusted his bass line subtly, creating a path for me to follow. Not the soprano harmony I'd planned to sing, but something simpler. Something that met me where I was instead of where I was supposed to be.

I followed his voice like a rope through darkness. My soprano came out quiet and uncertain, but it came out. Nick's bass provided the foundation, and I built on top of it, one careful note at a time.

Peter's lead melody floated above us both, and somewhere in the background, Tommy and Joey adjusted their harmonies to accommodate this new structure. We weren't singing the song the way it was supposed to be sung. But we were singing.

The harmonies locked together—not perfectly, not like the rehearsed performance they'd expected, but real and raw and somehow beautiful in its imperfection.

I stopped thinking about the crowd. Stopped thinking about my terror. I focused only on following Nick's steady bass line, on matching my uncertain soprano to his unwavering foundation.

My voice grew stronger as the song continued. Not confident, not performance-ready, but present. Alive.

When the final note faded, there was a moment of complete silence. Then the crowd erupted in applause—maybe for the performance, maybe just for the fact that I'd survived it.

I stood frozen, unable to process what had just happened.

Peter stepped forward, his smile bright and genuine. "Well, that was something different!" He clapped Nick on the shoulder. "Thanks for jumping in there, Nick. Good save."

"No problem," Nick said quietly.

Tommy and Joey nodded their approval, and Peter turned back to me. "You okay, Diane?"

I managed a nod, still not trusting my voice for actual words.

"The harmonies were interesting," Peter continued, speaking to the crowd now, his showman instincts taking over. "Not quite what we practiced, but hey, that's what makes live performance exciting!"

Polite laughter from the audience. I felt my face burning with embarrassment.

"Thanks for auditioning," Peter said to me, kind but clearly ready to move on to the next contestant.

I needed to leave the stage. Needed to get off this platform and out of the spotlight before I completely dissolved into mortified tears.

But first, I turned to Nick.

He'd moved back to his position at the rear of the group, already resetting for the next audition. When I caught his eye, he gave me a small, genuine smile. No pity. No judgment. Just... acknowledgment.

"Thank you," I managed to whisper.

He nodded once, and somehow I knew he'd heard me despite the crowd noise.

I descended the stairs on shaking legs. Sally was waiting at the bottom, her face a mixture of relief and concern.

"You did it," she said, pulling me into a quick hug. "Di, you actually did it. You didn't run."

"I almost ran."

"But you didn't. That's what matters."

We moved to the edge of the crowd as Peter called the next contestant. I couldn't watch anymore. Couldn't stand here and see other girls succeed where I'd nearly failed.

"I need to go home," I said.

"Wait for all the auditions to finish," Sally urged. "They're announcing the winner tonight."

"I didn't win, Sally. I barely survived."

"You don't know that. The way you and Nick sounded together—"

"Was a disaster that he salvaged out of pity." I shook my head, fighting back tears. "I'm going home. Tell me tomorrow who won."

Sally looked like she wanted to argue but saw something in my face that stopped her. "Okay. I'll walk with you."

"No, stay. Watch the rest. I'll be fine."

I left before she could protest further, walking quickly away from the bandstand, away from the crowd, away from my complete humiliation.

The boardwalk stretched out before me, the evening lights just beginning to flicker on. Behind me, I could hear the next audition starting—another girl with more courage and talent than I'd ever have.

I'd tried. Mama had said that was what mattered—not winning, but trying.

But trying and failing in front of hundreds of people felt worse than never trying at all.

I walked home through the gathering dusk, my blue dress feeling like a costume I'd worn to play a part I was never meant for. By the time I climbed the stairs to our apartment, tears were streaming down my face.

Mama took one look at me and pulled me into her arms without asking questions.

"I froze," I sobbed into her shoulder. "I completely froze up there. If Nick hadn't... if he hadn't stepped in..."

"But he did," Mama said softly. "And you didn't run. You finished the song."

"It doesn't matter. I failed."

"You were brave. That's not failure."

But it felt like failure. It felt like I'd finally stepped forward out of the shadows only to prove that I belonged there all along.

Later, lying in my bed with the window open and the sound of distant waves mixing with boardwalk music, I replayed those terrible minutes on stage over and over.

The panic. The silence. The humiliation.

And then Nick's voice, steady and sure, offering me something to hold onto when I was drowning.

I'd spent all summer watching Peter Castellano, dreaming about his attention, fantasizing about moments exactly like tonight. But when I'd actually needed someone, when I'd been at my most vulnerable and terrified, it hadn't been Peter who'd stepped forward.

It had been Nick.

The bass singer. The foundation. The one I'd barely noticed until he'd become impossible to ignore.

I fell asleep thinking about that deep voice wrapping around my panic, anchoring me to the moment, refusing to let me fall.
