# Chapter 25: Searching for Nick

The Bayside Boys finished their closing number to rousing applause. The crowd surged forward, not ready to let the magic end. Parents gathered children. Teenagers clustered in groups. Tourists snapped final photographs.

The end of summer. The end of everything familiar.

And maybe, if I was brave enough, the beginning of something new.

I pushed through the dispersing crowd, searching for Nick. The bandstand area swarmed with post-concert chaos. Joey and Tommy broke down equipment. Peter signed autographs, surrounded by admirers. Mr. Gennaro approached with wrapped packages—thank-you gifts for the performers.

But I didn't see Nick anywhere.

My heart sank. Where was he? Had the moment during the duet meant nothing?

"Diane!"

I turned to find Peter approaching, Barbara Wellington trailing behind him.

"Great show tonight! That duet you did with Nick was really something special."

"Thanks," I said, scanning the crowd behind him. Where was Nick?

"Some of us are heading to the diner. You should come."

"I can't. I'm meeting someone."

"Nick?" Peter's expression turned knowing. "You were singing to him up there, not to the crowd."

I met his eyes directly. "Yes."

"Figured. He's a good guy." Peter didn't sound hurt, just matter-of-fact. "You two make more sense together. Good luck."

He wandered off with Barbara, and I felt a strange sense of closure. Peter was exactly who he'd always been. He'd never been the right choice for me.

"Diane!" Sally grabbed my arm, her eyes bright with excitement and determination. "I just saw Tommy heading backstage. Nick's probably back there with the equipment."

My heart jumped. "Where's backstage exactly?"

"Behind the bandstand. There's a little space where they keep everything. Come on, I'll show you."

She pulled me through the thinning crowd, weaving between families gathering their things and teenagers lingering in groups. We passed Mrs. Kowalski from the bakery, who called out that the duet was beautiful. Mr. Chen from the arcade waved. I barely registered any of it, my mind focused entirely on finding Nick.

The backstage area wasn't obvious from the main boardwalk. Sally led me around to the side of the bandstand structure where a narrow opening was partially hidden by a painted screen advertising Coca-Cola. I'd walked past this spot dozens of times and never noticed it before.

Sally stopped at the entrance and gave me an encouraging push. "Go on. He's in there somewhere."

I hesitated, nerves suddenly overwhelming me. "What if he's not ready to talk? What if I'm too late and—"

"Diane Foster." Sally grabbed both my shoulders and looked me straight in the eyes, her expression fierce. "You've wasted the entire summer hiding from your real feelings. Nick's wasted it watching you chase after Peter when he was right there the whole time. You're both done wasting time. Now get in there and tell that boy you love him, or so help me, I will do it for you."

Despite my nervousness, I almost smiled. "You're terrifying when you're like this."

"I know. One of my best qualities." She softened slightly. "You can do this. Just be honest—that's all he wants. The real you, not some performed version."

I took a shaky breath. "Okay. I'm going."

"Good. I'll wait here. If anyone tries to interrupt, I'll run interference."

I slipped through the opening into the backstage area. It was smaller than I'd imagined—just a storage space behind the bandstand. Instrument cases lined one wall. Cables and equipment filled wooden crates. Folding chairs sat in the corner.

Tommy Morrison stood near the back, coiling cables with practiced efficiency. He glanced up when I entered, and a knowing smile crossed his face.

"Looking for Nick?"

"Is he here?"

"Took off about five minutes ago. Said he needed to think, wanted some air." Tommy gestured vaguely northward. "Probably headed toward the pier. That's where he goes when he needs space to clear his head."

My stomach dropped. The pier was at the far end of the boardwalk, a good ten-minute walk from here. "Did he seem okay? Did he seem upset?"

"More like confused. Hopeful maybe, but trying not to be." Tommy met my eyes directly. "Look, I don't know exactly what happened during that duet, but I've known Nick since we were kids. The guy's been half-dead inside for the past two weeks, just going through the motions. Tonight, for the first time, he actually looked alive again. So whatever you're planning to tell him, make it count."

"I will. I promise."

I turned to leave, but Tommy's voice stopped me.

"Diane? One more thing." He set down the cables he'd been coiling. "Nick's the best guy I know. He doesn't ask for much, doesn't push himself forward, always puts everyone else first. Makes sure the rest of us look good even when it means he stays in the background. But he deserves to be someone's first choice. Not their second option or their safe fallback. So if you're not absolutely sure about this—"

"I'm sure," I interrupted, meeting his eyes firmly. "I've never been more sure of anything in my life."

Tommy studied me for a long moment, then nodded with satisfaction. "Good. Then go find him before he talks himself out of hoping. And Diane? Don't let him hide in the background anymore. The guy's got too much talent to waste it being invisible."

"I won't. Thank you, Tommy."

I hurried back through the narrow opening to find Sally waiting with barely contained excitement.

"Well? Is he back there?"

"No. He went to the pier."

"Then go!" Sally gave me a firm push. "Run! And don't come back until you've told him everything!"

I lifted my skirt slightly and started half-running through the dispersing crowd. The boardwalk stretched ahead, lit by strings of lights and shop windows. Music drifted from various establishments—rock and roll, crooning ballads, the buzz of summer's last Saturday night.

People called out as I passed. Friends asked where I was rushing to. Mrs. Patterson commented that I looked flushed. I waved and kept moving, my heart pounding harder.

What was I going to say to him? How did you tell someone you'd been an idiot all summer?

The pier rose ahead of me, stretching out over the dark water like a wooden path to the moon. Couples strolled along it arm in arm, enjoying the romance of the moonlit ocean. A few families gathered near the far end where the view opened up completely. The sound of waves lapping against the pilings created a gentle rhythm beneath the boardwalk noise.

And there, about halfway down the pier, his back to the boardwalk, leaning against the railing and staring out at the endless dark water, stood Nick.

My steps slowed. He looked solitary. Vulnerable. Silhouetted against the moonlit ocean, his shoulders slightly hunched forward, his hands gripping the wooden railing like it was the only solid thing in his world.

Doubt crept in. What if I'd waited too long? What if the walls had rebuilt themselves in the minutes since the duet ended? What if he'd decided I wasn't worth the risk of being hurt again?

What if he said no?

I almost turned around. Almost walked away and let the moment pass, let summer end without telling him the truth. It would be safer that way. Less terrifying. I could go home and tell myself I'd tried, that at least I'd looked for him.

But then I heard Sally's voice in my head, fierce and uncompromising: He deserves to be someone's first choice.

And Mama's gentle wisdom: The things you don't do are what you regret most.

And my own truth, the one I'd finally stopped running from: I loved him. I'd been falling in love with Nick Romano for weeks, maybe from the very first moment he stepped forward to save my audition. I'd just been too scared and too stubborn to admit it.

But I was done being scared. Done hiding behind fantasy when reality was standing right there waiting for me to be brave enough to claim it.

I took a deep breath and walked forward, my footsteps echoing on the wooden boards.

Nick heard me coming. He turned, and surprise flickered across his face when he saw it was me. For a heartbeat we just looked at each other—me standing there breathless and disheveled from running, him guarded and hopeful and scared all at once, like he wanted desperately to believe I'd come looking for him but didn't quite dare.

"Hi," I said, because I couldn't think of anything better.

"Hi." His voice was soft, careful, like he was afraid of saying the wrong thing. "I thought you were going to wait at The Melody Box? After we packed up?"

"Tommy said you came this way. I didn't want to wait." I moved closer, close enough to see the wariness in his dark eyes. "I needed to find you."

"Oh." He turned partway back to the ocean, his shoulders tense, his hands gripping the railing. "About the duet tonight—"

"I meant it," I interrupted. "Everything I was trying to say through the music. I meant all of it, Nick."

His shoulders tensed further. He didn't turn around, didn't look at me. The silence stretched between us, broken only by the sound of waves against the pier pilings below and distant laughter from the boardwalk behind us.

"Diane..." His voice was barely audible. "I can't—I can't do this again. The back and forth. Thinking maybe you see me, and then watching you choose Peter. I can't be your second choice."

"You're not," I said fiercely. "Nick, please. Please look at me."

Slowly, so slowly, he turned. And the expression on his face nearly broke my heart—so much longing mixed with fear. So much hope fighting against the instinct to protect himself from more hurt. He looked like someone who wanted desperately to believe me but didn't quite dare.

Like someone who'd been disappointed too many times to trust easily.

"I need to tell you something," I said, my voice shaking slightly but determined. "And I need you to let me say it all before you respond, okay? Can you do that?"

He studied my face for a long moment, searching for something. Then, almost reluctantly, he nodded.

I took a deep breath. This was the moment where I stopped hiding behind fantasy and stepped into truth. Where I stopped being the girl who watched from a distance and became brave enough to claim what I wanted.

The waves crashed below us. The boardwalk music played behind us. And Nick stood there waiting, guarded and hopeful and scared, for me to finally say out loud what I'd been running from all summer.

So I opened my mouth and told him everything.
