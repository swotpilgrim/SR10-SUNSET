# Chapter 17: The Disappointing Date

Sunday evening arrived too quickly. I'd spent the day in anxious preparation. Three different outfits tried on and discarded. Hair styled, taken down, styled again.

Mama watched from my doorway with an expression I couldn't quite read.

"You look beautiful, honey."

"I look nervous." I turned from the mirror, smoothing my yellow sundress for the hundredth time. "Does this dress make me look too young? Should I wear the blue one instead?"

"You look perfect. But Diane..." She paused. "You don't have to go if you don't want to."

"Of course I want to." The words came out too sharp, defensive. "This is Peter Castellano. Any girl would want to."

"I didn't ask about any girl. I asked about you."

Before I could answer, a car horn honked outside. My stomach clenched.

"That's him." I grabbed my purse, checking for lipstick and powder compact. "I should go."

"Have fun, sweetheart. And remember—you can always change your mind about anything."

Peter's father's Chevy sat at the curb, cherry red and gleaming. Peter leaned against the driver's door, his hair perfectly styled.

"Evening, Diane. You look swell." He opened the passenger door with a flourish.

"Thank you. You too."

He started the engine and we pulled away, the radio playing something upbeat that matched nothing about how I felt.

"Excited for dinner?" Peter asked, his hand casual on the steering wheel.

"Yes. The Seaside Diner's supposed to have great milkshakes."

"The best. I go there all the time." He launched into a story about a waitress who always gave him extra fries because she was a fan of the Bayside Boys. I smiled and nodded at appropriate moments, watching the boardwalk slide past my window.

The Seaside Diner sat right on the main stretch—all chrome and neon with a massive sign that blinked OPEN in red letters. The parking lot was packed with other teenagers' cars, and I recognized several faces as Peter held the door for me with exaggerated chivalry.

"After you, m'lady." His grin was playful, charming.

Inside, the diner hummed with activity. Every booth seemed full, and the jukebox in the corner played Bobby Darin at maximum volume. A waitress in a pink uniform and white apron waved at Peter.

"The regular booth, Peter?"

"Thanks, Doris."

She led us to a red vinyl booth right in the center of the diner—the most visible spot in the entire restaurant. Several people turned to look as we slid in opposite each other. Peter waved at a few he recognized.

"You come here a lot," I observed.

"Best place to be seen in Bayshore." He said it without irony, like being seen was an obvious goal. "What do you want to eat?"

I started to open the menu, but Peter was already talking.

"Two cheeseburgers, extra pickles on mine, and two chocolate malteds. That work for you, Diane?"

"Actually, I prefer vanilla—"

"Trust me, their chocolate is way better. You'll love it." He handed both menus back to Doris without looking at me.

The uncomfortable feeling in my stomach intensified.

Peter leaned back in the booth, one arm stretched across the back of the seat, completely at ease. "So, this summer's been incredible for the group. We've had packed shows almost every night. I'm thinking of taking the Bayside Boys professional after I graduate."

"That sounds ambitious. What do the other guys think?"

"Oh, they're into it. Especially Nick—he's always working on new arrangements and stuff. Great at the technical side." Peter waved dismissively. "That's his thing, you know? The boring music theory stuff. I'm more about the performance, connecting with the audience. That's what really makes a show work."

I thought about Nick's notebook full of compositions, the hours of work that went into each arrangement, the mathematical beauty of harmonic structures.

"I think the technical stuff is pretty important too," I said carefully. "Without good arrangements, even great performers can't—"

"Sure, sure. But let's be real—people come to see me sing, not to analyze chord progressions." Peter grinned like this was obvious fact. "Nick's great at what he does, but he's background for a reason. Not everyone can handle the spotlight."

My hands clenched under the table. Nick could handle the spotlight. He chose not to be in it, which was completely different.

"Tell me about the audition," Peter continued, not noticing my tension. "I heard you completely froze up there. That must have been rough."

"It was terrifying," I admitted. "Stage fright is—"

"I've never had that problem." He said it matter-of-factly. "I love performing. Always have. Even when I was a kid, I'd put on shows for my family. My mom says I was born to be on stage."

"That must be nice. For me, singing in front of people is—"

"You just need more confidence. That's what Nick did for you, right? During the audition? He saw you panicking and jumped in." Peter shook his head admiringly. "That's Nick for you. Always helping people out, even when it means sharing his spotlight. Well, his tiny background spotlight." He laughed at his own joke.

Doris appeared with our food. I stared at the chocolate malted I hadn't wanted, the cheeseburger I hadn't been asked about.

"Dig in!" Peter took a huge bite of his burger.

I sipped the malted. It was too sweet, too thick. Everything about this date felt wrong.

Peter talked while he ate—about the group's plans for next summer, about a girl in Atlantic City who'd asked for his autograph and photo, about a local radio station that might interview them. He barely paused for breath, certainly not long enough for me to contribute more than occasional nods.

I found myself comparing this to evenings with Nick. How conversation flowed back and forth naturally. How he asked questions and actually listened to answers. How comfortable silences felt intimate rather than awkward.

"What about you?" Peter said suddenly. "You work at your mom's flower shop, right?"

Finally. A question about me. "Yes, I help her with—"

"That's sweet. Family business and all that." He took another bite. "My dad wants me to go into his insurance company, but that's not happening. I'm meant for bigger things, you know?"

And just like that, the question about me became another springboard for him to talk about himself.

I pushed my burger around my plate, appetite completely gone. How had I not seen this before? All those performances where I'd watched him work the crowd—of course he was charming. That was performing. That was the show.

But here, on an actual date, he wasn't trying to connect with me. He was performing at me, and I was just the latest audience member.

"You're quiet," Peter observed, reaching across the table to take my hand. "Everything okay?"

His hand felt wrong. Not like Nick's careful, warm touch. This felt calculated, another gesture from his performer's playbook.

"I'm fine. Just full." I gently extracted my hand to pick up my malted.

We finished eating with Peter filling every silence with stories about himself. When Doris brought the check, Peter paid with cash from his wallet and stood up.

"Ready to go?"

I nodded, grateful the meal was over. Maybe the drive home would be better. Maybe in private, without an audience, he'd actually ask me real questions or show genuine interest in me as a person.

But the drive back to Foster's Flowers was more of the same. Peter talked about music and performances and his plans. He asked nothing about my father who'd died, or my dreams, or the things that mattered to me beyond surface details.

By the time we pulled up in front of the flower shop, I felt emotionally exhausted. This wasn't a date. It had been a monologue I'd been trapped in for two hours.

Peter walked me to the door, still talking about something related to the group. At the door, he leaned in and kissed my cheek—a quick, practiced gesture that felt as hollow as everything else tonight.

"This was fun," he said. "We should do it again sometime."

"Maybe." I pulled out my key. "Thanks for dinner, Peter."

"Night, Diane. See you at tomorrow's performance."

I watched him drive away, his taillights disappearing down the street. Then I went inside and closed the door, leaning against it with my eyes closed.

"How was it?" Mama called from the living room.

I walked in to find her reading, the lamp casting soft light. She looked up at me and her expression shifted immediately.

"Oh, honey."

"It was awful." The words tumbled out. "Not awful like he was mean or did anything wrong. Just... empty. Hollow. He talked about himself the entire time and barely asked me anything. And when he did ask, he didn't really listen to the answer."

I sank onto the couch beside her, and she wrapped an arm around my shoulders.

"I spent all summer watching him, thinking he was perfect. Thinking if he just noticed me, everything would be magical. But Mama, there's nothing there. He's charming and handsome and fun to watch perform, but that's all he is. Performance. There's no real person underneath. Or if there is, he didn't show me."

"And how does that make you feel?"

I thought about it honestly. "Disappointed. But also... relieved? Like I finally see clearly for the first time all summer. Peter was a fantasy. A safe crush because it would never be real. And now that it's real, I don't want it."

"Do you know what you do want?"

Nick's face filled my mind. His quiet smile, his genuine interest, the way he saw me—really saw me—instead of just looking at me.

"I cancelled dinner with Nick's family for this," I whispered. "He invited me to meet his family, and I cancelled for a date with Peter. And Peter didn't even ask me a single real question about who I am."

"It's not too late to fix that," Mama said gently.

"What if it is? What if Nick thinks I chose Peter? What if he's done trying?"

"There's only one way to find out."

I nodded, but the thought of facing Nick tomorrow at the performance filled me with anxiety. How did I explain that I'd made a mistake? That I'd chased the wrong thing all summer?

How did I tell him that somewhere between our walks and our music and our conversations, I'd fallen for him without even realizing it?

I went to bed that night with Peter's meaningless cheek-kiss still feeling wrong on my skin, and Nick's absence feeling like a missing limb.

Tomorrow, I'd have to figure out how to fix what I'd broken.

If it wasn't already too late.
